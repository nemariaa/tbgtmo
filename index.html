    <p>There’s something… off about Jin Ling this morning. Perhaps it’s the way he’s tilting his head, widening his eyes in an attempt to look younger and more innocent than he is. Jiang Cheng’s nephew is sixteen going on seventeen, and the boy’s every waking moment is spent trying to figure out how to become more of a man – or at the very least, act like it.</p><p>That he’s behaving in a way completely opposite is the first clue that something’s not quite right. Jin Ling only pulls out this expression when he wants something. And Jiang Cheng is pretty sure he’s not going to like it.</p><p>His worst fears are confirmed when Jin Ling opens his mouth.</p><p>“Uncle…,” he begins, dragging the last syllable in something that could have been a whine if Jiang Cheng hadn’t made damn sure years ago that the brat <em>never</em> whined in front of him. “Can we go to the Cloud Recesses?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s eyebrow goes up and he represses a sigh. He expected something like that.</p><p>“Please?” Jin Ling adds. His eyes go even wider, and he’s fucking <em>pouting</em> now, looking for all the world like a puppy begging for a bone. “It’s Sizhui’s birthday today, and I want to give him something. Jingyi said they don’t celebrate birthdays in Gusu, and that’s fucking outrageous.”</p><p>“Watch your mouth,” Jiang Cheng corrects automatically. <em>He</em> might cuss like a sailor, but no son of Jiang Yanli is going to use such foul language. Not if he can help it.</p><p>Jin Ling ignores him, and continues.</p><p>“He’s turning eighteen today, and that’s super special; apparently in Gusu when that happens you get your own <em>jingshi</em> and swap out your forehead ribbon for a different one. To show you’re a man or something. I don’t really get the big deal, but there you go.”</p><p>The words all come out in a rush. It’s too early for this and Jiang Cheng’s head is spinning trying to follow everything. Jin Ling has never been a morning person, much like his uncle. Said uncle notes with a sinking heart that he hasn’t seen the boy this excited since the day he received Fairy.</p><p>So that’s the way the wind is blowing. He should have seen this coming; after all, he’s been raising the kid ever since he was a toddler still in diapers. The sudden interest in the <em>guqin</em>, the constant litany of “Sizhui says…”, the blushing and stammering whenever the Gusu Lan sect is mentioned, followed by indignant shrieking and an abrupt topic change – Jin Ling’s favourite diversionary tactic.</p><p>Really, Jiang Cheng’s an idiot for not seeing this earlier, but then he’s a master of denial. He’s not that stupid: he’s seen the longing looks and the obvious excitement whenever they have to make a diplomatic visit to the Cloud Recesses, but he’s been steadfastly ignoring the niggling feeling in the back of his mind that tells him <em>this could become a problem.</em></p><p>Oh, well. The damage is already done. He crosses his arms in a vaguely threatening pose Jin Ling has seen too many times to be intimidated by.</p><p>“And why must <em>we</em> go? Surely you don’t need me to come along on something so simple as a visit to another sect?”</p><p>Jin Ling fidgets. “But it’ll be awkward if I go alone,” he says petulantly.</p><p>The urge to roll his eyes is difficult to squash, but Jiang Cheng gives it a valiant attempt. He lets his hands fall to his sides again before he sighs.</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p>The answering squeal from Jin Ling almost makes him regret it. He really does spoil that boy.</p><p> </p>
    <hr/><p> </p>
    <p>The journey to Cloud Recesses is a short one, and silent. Despite his excited jabbering earlier, Jin Ling seems to have noticed his uncle’s foul mood, and wisely keeps his mouth shut. Jiang Cheng is thankful for the quiet. It gives him time to collect his thoughts before he goes back to <em>that place</em>. Before he sees <em>him</em> again.</p><p>The Yunmeng Jiang Sect Leader’s relationship with his adopted brother is… complicated, to say the least. Since the earth-shattering revelation that Jiang Cheng’s golden core is not, in fact, his own, the two of them have been attempting to reconcile. Things are better than they used to be, but thirteen years is a long time to hate someone and Jiang Cheng doesn’t know how to deal with its absence.</p><p>For a long time after the debacle at Luanzang-Gang, that hate was the only thing keeping him going. He’d lost his entire family, and been saddled with a baby nephew he had no idea what to do with, on top of his responsibilities as Sect Leader. Rebuilding Lotus Pier had been the work of years, and he’d had to fight back tears every time he saw the burnt-out husk of the home he’d grown up in. It had taken years, too, to stop seeing Ah-Jie in Jin Ling’s face, to stop thinking <em>that’s her smile</em> when his nephew laughed, to find a box big enough to hold all the heartache and lock it away where he couldn’t find it. Sometimes he’d find it a struggle to get up in the mornings, and nothing, not even Jin Ling’s crying or the mountain of responsibilities was enough to push him to face the world.</p><p>But then he’d think of Wei Wuxian. Of his adopted brother who had turned his back on Jiang Cheng’s family and destroyed everything he had ever loved, and he’d think <em>I have to fix what he broke</em>. Then the hate would come bubbling up again and Jiang Cheng would clutch it to himself, would cradle it like he cradled Jin Ling in the throes of his nightmares because that was the only thing that didn’t hurt. And then he went on.</p><p>Now, he’s floundering. Now, all he’s got is the bone-aching sadness that got dredged up from its cozy little box when Wei Wuxian came crashing back into his life. <em>Surprise, motherfucker</em>, because it’s been thirteen years and he’s only now discovering that time hasn’t dulled the pain at all.</p><p>Jiang Cheng shakes himself out of his thoughts. His life doesn’t have room for self-pity in it. He’s better than this; he has to be.</p><p>Ah-Niang’s voice rings in his ears. <em>Get your head out of your ass, boy. You’re a Sect Leader now – act like it!</em> He nearly smiles, but catches himself before a grin can slip out. He has an image to uphold, after all.</p><p>It’s not long before they arrive at the Cloud Recesses. The infamous cliff wall has more carvings than he remembers from his time here as a child. Yet more rules to follow – he’s heard the count is up to over four thousand now. Good thing he’s a visiting dignitary and doesn’t actually live here – the stuffiness would kill him. Jin Ling, too.</p><p>Idly, he wonders if he ought to send his nephew to study under Lan Qiren’s watchful eye for a few months. Gods know the boy needs the discipline, and he’d be glad of the opportunity to see Lan Sizhui every day.</p><p>The thought is pushed abruptly out of his mind when two figures appear at the entrance of the building itself. The shorter one, clad all in black, fairly bounces down the stairs and skids to a stop in front of Jiang Cheng, leaving his taller partner to walk towards them at a far more stately pace. Wei Wuxian looks different, of course, in the body of a disgraced former cultivation disciple, but his cheeky grin is the same. Blinding as ever.</p><p>It only gets wider when he sets eyes on Jin Ling.</p><p>“Nephew!”, he yells, and moves as if to go in for a hug. Jin Ling, startled, hides behind his other uncle, who resists the urge to hit something. By this time, Lan Wangji has reached them. His trademark blank expression doesn’t falter as he puts a hand on his husband’s shoulder.</p><p>“Wei Ying, shouting is prohibited in Cloud Recesses.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Jin Ling says sulkily. He doesn’t like being touched, which is something both he and Jiang Cheng have in common. “And don’t call me that.”</p><p>It looks like an argument is about to break out and as much as Jiang Cheng loves those, yelling at other people is less fun when you’re not the one doing it.</p><p>“Alright,” he snaps. “Just do what you came here to do, and go find Lan Sizhui.”</p><p>Luckily, Jin Ling listens and scrams without another word. Which means that Jiang Cheng is now alone with Wei Ying and his expressionless husband. Fucking wonderful.</p><p>This is what he’s been dreading the whole way here. The tension in the air is palpable, and it’s so awkward Jiang Cheng wants to run away and hide. He’d never show it, of course, so he cues up his frostiest tone and cocks an eyebrow.</p><p>“Good to see you again,” he says.</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s smile dims a bit at the cold greeting, and Lan Wangji puts his arm around him. It’s a protective gesture, even though his expression doesn’t change; the message is loud and clear. <em>Hurt him, and I’ll tear out your entrails and feed them to you</em>. Okay, maybe he’s embellishing a little. It’s more like just<em> don’t</em>. Hanguang-Jun is a man of few words, and it’s doubtful he’d waste them on Jiang Cheng.</p><p>The grin comes back in full force.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Wei Wuxian asks, in an effort to diffuse the tension. Then he realises how that sounds, and backtracks hurriedly. “I mean, why’d you decide to visit? Is there some sort of inter-sect diplomatic meeting I haven’t been told about?”</p><p>“No, actually. Jin Ling told me it’s Lan Sizhui’s birthday today, and he wishes to deliver his congratulations in person.”</p><p>The words are stiff and formal, and Jiang Cheng aches for simpler times, when he and his brother-in-all-but-name were joined at the everything, and a look was all it took to have an entire conversation. But too much has happened since then, and it shows.</p><p>They devolve into polite, if stilted, conversation about the children, and how their respective sects are doing. The Gusu Lan sect leader, Lan Xichen, is still in seclusion after the whole Jin Guangyao mess, and Lan Qiren and Lan Wangji are running things in his absence.</p><p>Honestly, Jiang Cheng can’t blame the guy, though he is a little envious. There have <em>definitely</em> been times in the past thirteen years where he’d love to have done the same thing, but he hadn’t had the safety net to fall back on that Lan Xichen obviously has. The lack of a family and a toddler to raise was a definite disadvantage, but somehow he wouldn’t trade Jin Ling for the world. Irritating as he can be at times.</p><p>“…alright with you?” Wei Wuxian asks. With a start, Jiang Cheng suddenly realises he’d zoned out at some point during the conversation and lost the thread of discussion. He tunes back in with an effort.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Wei Wuxian heaves a theatrical, put-upon sigh, like repeating a sentence for his dumb little brother is some great trial to be overcome.</p><p>“I <em>said</em>, Hanguang-Jun and I are going down to Caiyi village to pick up some stuff. Are you coming or not?”</p><p>“Depends. What are you buying?”</p><p>A waggle of the eyebrows, followed by a leer. “Stuff.”</p><p>“Mmm,” agrees Lan Wangji.</p><p>Well, Jiang Cheng knows what <em>that </em>means, and hell if he’s going to be there for it. Third-wheeling is uncomfortable as shit. He’ll just stay up here where it’s nice and quiet, and he can be single in peace. He says as much to the happy couple (but only the first part – he’ll never live it down if Wei Wuxian figures out he’s less than content with his bachelor status).</p><p>The Second Jade of Gusu gives another “hmm” before dragging his partner away, Wei Wuxian throwing out a quick goodbye before they disappear around a corner and out of sight. Jiang Cheng allows himself a quick smile before his customary scowl makes a reappearance. He’s managed an entire conversation without blowing up or someone getting hurt. That’s a win, in his book.</p><p>He turns towards the entrance to Cloud Recesses. There’s a quiet corner behind the disciples’ dormitories that he remembers from his student days with his name on it. Maybe a nap is in his future. It has been a while since he’s been able to relax.</p><p>Just then, the great doors burst open, and a small, white-clad figure darts out.</p><p>“LAN JINGYI!!!”</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng hasn’t heard Lan Qiren yell since his own student days at the Cloud Recesses, when Wei Wuxian was consistently sending him over the edge. And everyone knows how that turned out. That Lan Jingyi – an actual Lan, no less! – could achieve the same result as a teenaged Yiling Patriarch is nothing short of awe-inspiring.</p><p>The kid tears full-tilt towards Jiang Cheng and shoves something furry into his chest. He brings his hands up to catch it before it drops and the thing fucking <em>squirms</em>. Holy shit.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Sect Leader Jiang. Please take it. Lan Qiren is mad at me and I need to hide.” Jiang Cheng looks down at the thing he’s holding. It’s a rabbit. What the hell is Lan Jingyi doing with a bunny?</p><p>The teen looks like he’s freaking the fuck out, and the panicked expression on his face almost makes Jiang Cheng laugh. Years of practice at controlling his facial expressions saves him, however, because as funny as this is, even he’s not cold-hearted enough to laugh at such obvious suffering.</p><p>“Hanguang-Jun asked me to look after his rabbits while he and Senior Wei went out and Sizhui was busy so I had to do it by myself. I was doing a good job, I swear. I had all of them in an enclosure but this one got out and I’ve been chasing it all over.”</p><p>Now that he’s mentioned it, Jiang Cheng notices that Lan Jingyi does look very red, flushed and panting like he’s run several hundred-yard dashes. Or in this case, chased a freedom-loving rabbit across Gusu’s massive campus. He continues to ramble, obviously not wanting to be mistaken for not having done his job.</p><p>“I tried, you know, I really did, but did you know bunnies are really fast?”, Lan Jingyi asks mournfully. “Then it got into Lan Qiren’s study and knocked over an entire bottle of ink and ruined some important documents and I’m in so much <em>trouble</em>. Please don’t sell me out, Sect Leader Jiang. He’ll kill me if he finds me!”</p><p>The last part comes out in a wail and the absurdity of the situation hits Jiang Cheng full-force. He can’t remember the last time a Lan asked him for something, much less to cover for one after drawing their master’s ire. The opportunity is too good to pass up – after all, he’s received too many punishments from Lan Qiren himself to not want to get one over on him. It’s petty, but hey, he’s still got a scar on his back from the old man’s punishment whip. He’s allowed to be petty.</p><p>The rabbit is wriggling now, trying to escape his hold. He shifts his grip to hold it tightly around the middle.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t tell. Now scram, kid, before I change my mind.”</p><p>Lan Jingyi thanks him profusely, and dashes off in the opposite direction, presumably to try to become one with the trees. Jiang Cheng sighs. He’s probably going to regret this.</p><p>That much is confirmed when the doors open again and another figure in white steps out. His steps are full of the Gusu Lan sect’s characteristic grace and elegance, but the man’s face is red with fury and the end of his beard is quivering a bit. Lan Qiren looks exactly like he did over a decade ago, down to the creases in his forehead and the still-jet-black hair. He stalks down the stairs and approaches the other sect leader.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s too old and too powerful now to be cowed by his wrath (that it’s not directed at him doesn’t hurt either), so he stays put, bringing his other arm up to conceal the rabbit behind the long sleeve of his robe. Its fur is soft and smooth against his skin, and the small animal squirms a little in protest. He smooths his features into placidity.</p><p>“Good morning, Master Lan,” he greets the other man.</p><p>Lan Qiren gives a slight bow in return. “Good morning, Sect Leader Jiang. Forgive my abruptness, but have you seen Lan Jingyi?”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“The boy has managed to make a mess of several crucial letters, one of which was to have gone to Yunmeng. I apologise, but it seems that our correspondence is to be delayed for some days yet.”</p><p>With no small amount of puzzlement, Jiang Cheng wonders at the contents of that letter. He hasn’t sent anything to Gusu in recent weeks that would warrant a reply, and when he thinks of important events that might be coming up, his mind draws a blank. Oh, well. He’ll just have to wait.</p><p>“No, Master Lan. Unfortunately, I have not seen the boy,” he replies. He’s a better liar than he used to be, but Nie Huaisang has informed him repeatedly that he is far from a good one. Apparently, he has too many tells.</p><p>Lan Qiren scowls. “Hmph.”</p><p>Then he bids his goodbyes and walks away, in a direction about fifteen degrees off from where Lan Jingyi went. Once he’s far enough away, Jiang Cheng takes out the rabbit, which has thankfully ceased its wriggling.</p><p>Small, beady black eyes bore into his face. He strokes the long brown ears absently, feeling how they twitch under his fingers.</p><p>“What on earth am I going to do with you?”, he asks it. The bunny, of course, does not reply.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>He ends up taking it to the little garden he’d originally planned on inhabiting. It’s a nice, quiet place, boxed in by walls and the back of the disciples’ sleeping quarters – all snow-white of course. Everything in Cloud Recesses is so fucking <em>pristine</em>. Anyway, there’s a fountain in the corner, and the ground is covered by a perfect green lawn that’s only broken up by a few fallen leaves from the apple tree at one wall.</p><p>Obviously a nap is now out of the question, with an over-energetic rabbit to look after. He fixes it with a baleful glare; its nose twitches in response. The damn thing’s already shown a penchant for getting into trouble, so he’ll have to keep an eye on it until either Lan Jingyi or Hanguang-Jun comes back to collect it.</p><p>The rabbit goes down on the grass, where it scampers back and forth. Jiang Cheng himself sits down on a bench carved out of white stone, placed near the fountain.</p><p>Few other people know about this place – at least the ones not native to Gusu. He’d discovered it by accident his second month here as a disciple, after Wei Wuxian had dared him to walk on the dormitory roof. There had been a rain a few hours prior, and the surface was slippery. Never all that graceful to begin with, he’d fallen off and landed in the small garden.</p><p>It had taken him close to half an hour to figure out how to get back to the dorms – the Cloud Recesses were a maze if you didn’t know exactly where you were going, which was what made it so difficult to attack.</p><p>After that, he came back here whenever he was upset, or needed to think about something. It was where he went after the fight with Jin Zixuan that had gotten Wei Wuxian sent back to Lotus Pier, when he’d had to stay behind for another two weeks to finish out the semester.</p><p>Jiang Cheng misses it in a way. Not the indignation and the loneliness – that has never really gone away – but the space, the room to think without disturbance. It’s rare that he gets any time to himself nowadays, what with parenting Jin Ling, night hunts and sect leader duties. He supposes it’s at least partly his fault – he wouldn’t be having half as much trouble if he wasn’t so involved with everything that goes on in Yunmeng. If he were more like Jin Guangshan, well…</p><p>The rabbit pokes at his robes, sniffing the folds as if looking for something to eat. He pets it absently, then stifles a yelp of surprise as it darts away and makes a mad dash towards the garden’s exit.</p><p><em>Damn it</em>. When Lan Jingyi told him that rabbits move fast, he wasn’t really counting on finding out for himself. He pulls himself to his feet and gives chase, cursing the kid as he runs. <em>It’s his fault I’m in this mess in the first place</em>. He knows he’s under no obligation to look after the damn thing, that if it goes missing it’ll be Lan Jingyi’s ass in the fire, but if that’s Hanguang-Jun’s rabbit, he’s not taking any chances.</p><p>He’s not ashamed to admit he’s a little afraid of the other man. Over the years, Lan Wangji has built himself a reputation of being where the chaos is, of finding the biggest, baddest, nastiest situation and throwing himself headfirst into it. And he always, <em>always</em> comes out on top. Now that the truth has come out about his relationship with the one-time Yiling Patriarch, Jiang Cheng is moderately sure that part of this lack of caring was born from a semi-death wish after Wei Wuxian kicked the bucket.</p><p>Considering that it was Jiang Cheng who killed him, he really doesn’t want to give the Second Jade of Gusu any more reason to hate him. It’s not like he <em>likes</em> having to back down every time he has a confrontation with the other man, but there are people who still need him around, so he’s not planning on dying just yet.</p><p>There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to the rabbit’s running route; it leads him through twists and turns in the corridors so convoluted that Jiang Cheng is pretty sure he’s lost. This is <em>not</em> how he planned on spending his day. He makes a grab for the furry monster every twenty steps or so, but it seems intent on evading capture, darting just out of reach.</p><p>He keeps at it, though. Damn thing’s got to run out of steam eventually, and he’s pretty confident in his own stamina.</p><p>The corridors are long and twisty, and the only sounds are his harsh breaths and the soft ‘scritch’ of the rabbit’s tiny claws on the stone floor. Thank the gods that there’s no one around to witness this humiliation. Then stone changes to slatted wood, the halls get longer, and suddenly a small cottage appears out of fucking <em>nowhere</em>. The bunny stops dead.</p><p>They’re in a part of Cloud Recesses that Jiang Cheng’s never seen before. Here, the narrow white corridors open up onto a large garden – much larger than the one they were in before. There are flowers everywhere, from daisies to daffodils, roses and peonies and carnations in rows upon rows of brightly-coloured blooms.</p><p>It should be a riot of colours, but everything is neatly ordered, and there’s a colour scheme for maximum impact. It’s so very… <em>Lan</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng takes advantage of the rabbit’s momentary stillness to lunge forward and grab it firmly with both hands. It wriggles like an eel, but he holds determinedly on to the squirmy ball of fluff. He’s not letting it go again; not after last time.</p><p>“Fucking stay still, you stupid rabbit!”, he yells in frustration.</p><p>He suddenly sounds very loud in the previously-quiet garden. Yes, Jiang Cheng knows he is screaming at a rabbit, which is not the smartest thing he’s ever done, and yes, he is very much aware of what he sounds like. But he’s never claimed to be good at controlling his temper and what he loathes more than anything else in the world is something that <em>will not listen to him</em>.</p><p>“Who’s there?”</p><p>A voice rings out, and Jiang Cheng freezes. <em>Fuck</em>, some part of his brain thinks. He may be a visiting sect leader, but this is Lan home turf, and as such, he is bound by their rules as long as he is here.</p><p>Stupid as they may be, he’s probably broken at least ten with this little stunt: yelling and swearing and running and probably breaking into whatever part of Cloud Recesses this place is. Since he’s never seen it before, he’ll hazard a guess that it’s prohibited and oh shit he’s screwed.</p><p>The owner of the voice rounds the back of the cottage and comes into view. Tall, slim, dressed all in white… Jiang Cheng’s inner panic intensifies. This is worse than he thought. Much, much worse.</p><p>The cottage obviously belongs to Lan Xichen, Gusu Lan sect leader, sworn brother of Nie Mingjue and Jin Guangyao, who, in mourning for his fallen brothers, has locked himself into seclusion. Seclusion that Jiang Cheng has just broken.</p>

    <p><em>Okay, stay calm. You’ve been in worse situations before</em>. Jiang Cheng thinks about what he knows of the other man. Zewu-Jun has a reputation of being gentle and kind, slow to anger and forgiving when he finally does. All good things, but he remembers Wei Wuxian telling him that Lan Xichen had once gotten pissed at him. His adopted brother’s exact words had been: “it was one of the scariest things that’s ever happened to me”.</p><p>The man’s been living as a hermit for nearly a year now. Who knows what that’s done to his temper.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jiang Cheng’s not a coward. He didn’t rebuild his sect from the ground up to become one of the most powerful in the world by shying away from confrontation.</p><p>He lets his expression smooth into one of polite disaffection and gives a shallow bow. They are equals here.</p><p>“Zewu-Jun. Good morning. I apologise for intruding on your private quarters.”</p><p>The other man inclines his head, and Jiang Cheng gets his first good look at him. Lan Xichen, though he appears so similar to his younger brother Lan Wangji that many have difficulty distinguishing between the two, has held first place on the list of cultivators published every year for over a decade. His appearance has not declined at all, even after a year of being locked away from the rest of the world.</p><p>He is still clad in the characteristic white-and-light-blue uniform of the Gusu Lan sect, but his flowing black hair is tied back only in a loose ponytail. The signature forehead ribbon rests above his eyebrows, though the knot that holds it in place is much less elaborate than the one his brother uses.</p><p>Clearly, he is not dressed to receive visitors, but if he is surprised to see Jiang Cheng, he hides it well. The smile on his face is genial as ever, though it does not seem to reach his eyes. In fact, there is an air of melancholy about him that was not there a year ago, and it hits Jiang Cheng for the first time that this could very well be the reason Lan Xichen no longer associates with society.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang,” the other man replies. “An unexpected pleasure to find you here.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng searches Lan Xichen’s expression for hints of sarcasm and finds none. Odd, but then he has cultivated a reputation for being genuinely kind. He and Hanguang-Jun may look similar, but the older of the two is near-infinitely more personable.</p><p>He pulls himself out of his thoughts just then, realising that he’d better give an explanation for being in this very obviously prohibited place without permission. It would be the height of rudeness not to do so, and while he is not known for being the epitome of manners, to behave in such a way would reflect badly upon his sect.</p><p>Holding up the rabbit, he forces an apologetic smile. “It’s rather a long story, I’m afraid, but suffice to say I accidentally came into temporary guardianship of one of Hanguang-Jun’s rabbits. It… well, it rather got away from me.”</p><p>To his surprise, Lan Xichen actually laughs. It’s a nice sound, deep and melodic, and it eases the sadness that clings to him like a cloud.</p><p>Jiang Cheng feels the tips of his ears flush a little red with embarrassment. He does suppose it is amusing, to some degree, though humiliating. Sect leaders are supposed to be dignified, and the thought of one chasing a rabbit all over a school campus is decidedly not.</p><p>“As I am, the thing I have most of is time. Perhaps you can tell me more of this story. It promises to be an interesting one.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">…</p><p> </p><p>Lan Huan studies the man in front of him carefully. Jiang Wanyin is tall – nearly as tall as he is. Handsome too, with well-defined features and a sharp jawline, but his famous scowl usually detracts from that. Not today, however.</p><p>Today, he simply looks tired. There are faint dark circles under his eyes from lack of sleep. He is at least five years Lan Huan’s junior, but he stands as if bearing the burdens of someone much older, though his posture is impeccable as ever.</p><p>He remembers meeting the other man at sect leader gatherings, with the others like Nie Huaisang in attendance. (He avoids thinking about Jin Guangyao. That wound is still too fresh, too painful to poke at.) The Yunmeng Jiang sect leader does not stand out in his memory, though he was always easily the youngest person there; they have never had overmuch contact, rarely speaking to each other outside of the formal contexts in which discussion was necessary.</p><p>Briefly, he wonders why that is, before the other man starts speaking. He was not wrong – it <em>is</em> a funny story. Lan Jingyi is easily the most excitable of the current disciples, though full of character and courage. He’s heard tell that the boy is afraid of the corpses they hunt, but participates eagerly in night-hunts in order to overcome his fear.</p><p>“And that,” Jiang Wanyin finishes, “is how I ended up here.”</p><p>There is a slight smile on his face as he strokes the rabbit’s furry ears. It is strange to see the infamous Sandu-Shengshou without his scowl, but this new expression suits him. He thinks the other man looks rather like his mother; though he’d only met the Violet Spider a few times before her untimely death, the woman left a strong impression. They have the same nose, and the same soft mouth that hides the same sharp tongue.</p><p>Lan Huan extends his hand and after a slight hesitation, Jiang Wanyin passes the rabbit over. Its white-spotted brown fur is soft and silky – his little brother’s pets are obviously well-cared for. He doesn’t recall seeing this one before, but Wangji’s visits are infrequent (as dictated by the rules of their sect) and he rarely brings his pets along, preferring to spend time with his brother alone.</p><p>Animals are alright, he supposes, but he likes people better. Or he used to, anyway. Now, he thinks Wangji might be on to something. Animals are simple, uncomplicated; if you treat them well, they’ll do the same to you. People, even the ones you think you love, are liable to stab you in the back if they think it will bring them some benefit.</p><p>
    <em>When did I get so cynical?</em>
    </p><p>He banishes the thoughts before they can settle in his bones and grow bitter. It’s growing harder to stave off those feelings; isolated here as he is, there is little to occupy his time, and often all he can do is think.</p><p>“It’s beautiful up here.” The other man is attempting small talk. It’s awkward, and Lan Huan gets the feeling that Jiang Wanyin doesn’t do this very often. “Especially the flowers.”</p><p>“Yes, they are, aren’t they? They were my father’s, actually.”</p><p>Qingheng-Jun had been the first of Lan Huan’s family to go into seclusion. He’d spent more than half his life locked away in this very cottage by his own design, doing penance for sins no one understood why he’d committed. His father had wasted so much time punishing himself for his decisions, but Lan Huan had always thought that his people were the ones who were truly suffering under the weight of that punishment.</p><p>The man had left his younger brother to run the sect, and his two young sons to raise themselves. Now the older of those two sons was following in his father’s footsteps.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin looks up. Storm-grey eyes meet his, and he thinks the other man might understand some of what he feels.</p><p>Before the beginning of the Sunshot Campaign – even before Lotus Pier burned to the ground, there had been whispers about the then-Yunmeng sect leader. Jiang Fengmian had disliked his only son, it was said, going out of his way to avoid interaction with the young disciple, instead favouring his adopted older son, Wei Wuxian.</p><p>Lan Huan had been only a teenager himself then, but he remembers the rumours.</p><p>He sets the rabbit down, and it dashes into the flower bushes. Rabbits eat leaves, he remembers too late. <em>Oh, well</em>. Worst-case scenario, it will give him something to do.</p><p>He decides to continue talking. It’s been a while since his last visitor; to be honest, he’s glad of the company. Sect Leader Jiang will be leaving soon anyway, so he might as well make the most of the time he’s got.</p><p>“You know, when my father first came up here, he decided to plant every clan flower in this garden, so that all the sects would be represented.”</p><p>The other man’s eyebrow goes up.</p><p>“I don’t see any lotuses,” he says curtly.</p><p>Of course not. The Jiang sect’s signature flowers require copious amonts of water to grow. The ones here are all planted in earth.</p><p>“There’s a pond behind the cottage – you’ll find some there. I can take you to have a look, if you’d like.”</p><p>That gets a sharp nod. Jiang Wanyin seems ill at ease. No wonder – they’ve never been close, as Lan Huan has thought before. He suddenly remembers that the other man used to live here, was sent, as a teenager, to the Cloud Recesses to train like so many of his peers.</p><p>There is a quick flash of a memory, of a day hunting water ghouls in Caiyi village. Wangji excited for the first time about a boy he liked, a basket of sweet persimmons, and a fierce, serious boy dressed in purple, hovering in the background behind his much-more-obvious older brother.</p><p>It’s surprising that he hasn’t thought of this before, but back then, Jiang Wanyin only existed in conjunction with Wei Wuxian. Lan Huan had mostly paid attention to the latter, because his little brother seemed to have taken a shine to the boy. Why does that make him feel… guilty?</p><p>They round the back of the small building, coming in full view of a circular pond. Lan Huan turns to look at his companion, who remains silent as ever, though there is a light of appreciation in his eyes.</p><p>This extension of the garden is beautiful, much like the rest of the Cloud Recesses. Its allure is different, though, slightly wilder. Less tame. Ponds are much harder to maintain than dirt gardens, and it shows. Where the other flower bushes have been manicured to within an inch of their lives, the lotuses and water lilies that grow on the surface of the clear water have been allowed to sprout in clumps.</p><p>It is uncontrolled, it is disorganised, and it is Lan Huan’s favourite part of the grounds he lives on these days.</p><p>From the look on Jiang Wanyin’s face, he feels much the same way.</p><p>“Personally, I like this area the best,” the Gusu Lan sect leader says, sitting down on a conveniently-placed stone bench at the edge of the pond. A duck quacks from somewhere near a particularly thick patch of duckweed.</p><p>The other man joins him on the short bench. There is little space for two grown men, especially with Lan Huan’s broad shoulders from hours of handstands as a disciple that he keeps up with even now, but he finds he doesn’t particularly mind. Despite Sandu-Shengshou’s reputation for coldness and spite, he’s been nothing but pleasant company thus far.</p><p>The man in question pulls something out of the pocket of his robes. It’s white and round: a rice cracker.</p><p>Lan Huan is puzzled. Why would anyone carry that around with them, especially for a visit to another sect? He must not be as good at concealing his surprise as he’d thought, because Jiang Wanyin pulls a face.</p><p>“Don’t ask.”</p><p>Long fingers deftly break the thin cracker up into small, even pieces. He offers Lan Huan half of them and tosses the rest into the pond. Loud quacking suddenly fills the air as two more ducks appear and all three lunge for the food at once, bickering among themselves.</p><p>He understands now. Mimicking the other man, he throws in the rest of the cracker. The two of them watch as the ducks gobble up their meal. Then, finding no more, they return to their business.</p><p>The sun is warm overhead, just past its zenith and settling into early afternoon. Neither man says anything, content to simply enjoy the quiet atmosphere. Lan Huan leans back against the bench, enjoying the light, and the presence of someone else by his side, however fleeting.</p><p>There is a smile on his face, but it seems less false than usual.</p>

    <p>It’s another few hours before the sun begins to dip slowly towards the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple only slightly lighter than the Yunmeng Jiang sect’s robes.</p><p>They spend the time talking, Jiang Wanyin filling Lan Huan in on the goings-on of the world outside the cottage. Lan Huan shares his younger brother’s stories of life in the Cloud Recesses: the recent intake of new disciples, Lan Jingyi’s attempts to master the <em>guqin</em> (that have thus far met only with failure), Wei Wuxian’s latest shenanigans…</p><p>The other man goes very quiet at the last one. He listens with laser-like focus, but there is an odd expression on his face that Lan Huan can’t decipher. It is as if he is thirsty for information about his estranged brother, but unable to admit to himself that he misses him. Jiang Wanyin is warring with himself, and it is a fight he cannot help but lose.</p><p>The conversation is interspersed with long silences, too, when they come to the end of one topic and have not yet begun the next. The quiet is not uncomfortable; there is no awkward rambling to fill the gaps, and it is strangely peaceful for the lack of tension.</p><p>Lan Huan, for all his apparent optimistic attitude, is one who enjoys calm. This sort of interaction suits him. These days, he cannot sustain a conversation for long.</p><p>It’s too draining: the constant questions about his mental state, how he’s <em>feeling</em> (that is a can of worms he’s not going to open) that he can barely bring himself to brush off with a gentle smile and subtle topic change. He’s <em>fine</em>, thank you very much, because the leader of the Gusu Lan sect lets challenges and heartbreak roll off his back like water and forges ahead regardless. It’s how he’s dealt with his mother’s death, his father’s murder, and every crisis since.</p><p>It’s also a complete lie, and he can’t keep it up these days. Pretending is just too exhausting. He’d rather not be seen at all than have the others get a glimpse of him this way, broken and tired. Part of his mind whispers that he is a coward, but he ignores it. He’s good at ignoring things, now.</p><p>It didn’t used to be that way. People used to say he was perceptive, and it was true. He was the only person to be able to read his brother, to look past Wangji’s blank exterior and see the intense emotions he hid inside. But maybe he’s always been blind. How else could he have failed to see what Jin Guangyao had become? Or perhaps that part of his sworn brother was already there, had always been there, and he hadn’t realised…</p><p><em>No, we’re not going there</em>.</p><p>He focuses on the here and now – the sound of Jiang Wanyin’s deep voice, the smooth glimmer of sunlight reflected on the water, the faint scent of lotus flowers and lilies.</p><p>When the sky begins to grow dark, the other man stands up.</p><p>“It is getting late,” he states obviously. His pale fingers twist absently at the silver ring around his right forefinger. It seems to be a habit. “I need to collect my nephew.”</p><p>Lan Huan gets to his feet as well.</p><p>“Of course,” he says. “If you wish to return to Lotus Pier before nightfall, you must leave soon.”</p><p>Together, they return to the garden at the front of the cottage. Both of them had forgotten about the rabbit, and they share a look tinged with panic. Lan Huan does not want to be responsible for losing his brother’s pet the first time he’s met it. From the looks of it, neither does Jiang Wanyin.</p><p>By a mutual, silent agreement, they both sink to their knees, and begin searching the bushes for a hint of brown fur. At least the other man’s robes are dark, he thinks ruefully. It’s going to be a nightmare to wash dirt stains out of his white uniform. Good thing there’s no one around to scold him for dirtying his clothes.</p><p>A smile comes to his face, along with an image of a red-faced Lan Qiren, his beard and mustache trembling. With his father out of the picture, it had fallen to his uncle to discipline him and his brother. Always a quiet, obedient child, Wangji was scarcely any trouble at all. <em>He</em>, however, had been a different story.</p><p>They poke around their respective flower bushes for a few minutes, before Lan Huan’s frantic searching is interrupted by a cry of “found it!”. Jiang Wanyin stands, a struggling ball of fluff in one hand, the other brushing off the knees of his robes.</p><p>“Damn rabbit,” he mutters. There are tiny flecks of dirt on his face, which Lan Huan finds ridiculously endearing, despite his gruff manner. The rabbit paws at his hand, trying to get free, and he strokes its neck until it calms down. Like this, Sandu-Shengshou looks little like the legendary fierce sect leader he is, and rather more like one of the older disciples on a day off.</p><p>He notices Lan Huan staring at his face and wipes at it with a corner of his sleeve.</p><p>“I suppose I’d better go back then.”</p><p>Lan Huan imitates his little brother. “Hmm,” he says.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>They say goodbye in the garden, since Lan Xichen can’t leave the tiny grounds the cottage sits on. Both of them keep to the manners that have been ingrained in them since childhood; it is everything a diplomatic parting between two sect leaders should be.</p><p>Jiang Cheng supposes Lan Xichen truly is as much of a saint as he’s rumoured to be – Zewu-Jun has managed to put up with him for an entire afternoon and remain as calm as ever. As much as he’s unwilling to admit it, that is quite a feat.</p><p>As he’s walking back through the winding corridors, following the directions the other man has given him, he remembers the soft feeling that took root in his belly during their time at the pond. It feels… it feels rather like the warm glow of friendship he used to share with Wei Wuxian, once upon a time, when things were simpler.</p><p>He’s forgotten that feeling in the long years since. The leader of the Yunmeng Jiang sect doesn’t have time to have friends. He fulfills his duties, cares for Jin Ling, goes on night hunts to maintain his skills, and that’s it. There are only so many hours in a day, after all.</p><p>Now that he thinks about it, his life seems rather empty.</p><p>For over thirteen years, Jin Ling has been the only bright spot in his life. As much stress as raising a child that is not his pretty much single-handedly has given him, it’s also brought him untold amounts of joy. He was there for the kid’s first words, first steps, first night hunt, first everything. He knows how much of a privilege that is, especially since the price of it was his big sister’s life. (That price was too high to pay for anything at all.)</p><p>But his nephew’s growing up now. He’s sixteen and already a sect leader, and Jiang Cheng’s heart fucking <em>aches</em> for him, because he knows how hard it is to bear such a heavy burden so young.</p><p>The boy is brave and immature and mischievous, but most of all, he’s so, so bright, and Jiang Cheng loves him for it. Being sect leader takes all that brightness and hardens it, turns it from a bonfire into a focused laser, into a weapon you have to learn too fast how to wield. Being a sect leader means power, but that’s dangerous, because there are always people who want to take it from you. Who are willing to use any means necessary to do it.</p><p>Jiang Cheng knows all about those kinds of people. He’s killed his fair share.</p><p>That’s not what he wants for the child he’s raised. That’s not what Jiang Yanli would have wanted her son to grow up to be. Hell, it’s one of the reasons he decided to take Jin Ling in the first place. The only other option for guardian was Jin Guangyao and <em>fuck no</em> he was not going to let that scumbag get his paws on his nephew. That sad excuse for a human being would have turned the kid into an exact carbon copy of his twisted self: power-hungry and ruthless.</p><p>As he is, Jin Ling may be a bit of a spoiled brat (Jiang Cheng takes full responsibility for his failings as a pseudo-parent), but he could have been infinitely worse. He has a good heart and a desire to protect people, and Jiang Cheng will do anything to keep it that way.</p><p>Not that he’d ever tell the boy that, of course. Another one of his failings.</p><p>Sometimes he wishes he could, was able to say “I love you” without his throat freezing up on the first word, could pull Jin Ling into a hug the way he wished his father had done with him without his arms locking into place by his sides.</p><p>But he can’t. He doesn’t know why, and he wishes he did because Jin Ling is so much like he was at that age, all sharp edges and sullen looks hiding an insecure little boy that screamed <em>look at me please. Please be proud of me</em>.</p><p>So he tells him the only way he knows how: he hovers behind him, a shadow-like presence that will always keep him safe even if the boy doesn’t know it. Barks out orders and threats to break his legs because that’s how he says “you’re important to me”.</p><p>The rabbit is a warm presence against his arm, tucked securely in the crook of his elbow, reminding him that there are other things in the world besides his existential misery. True to form, it makes another bid for freedom once they reach the entrance of the maze they’d entered that morning. This time, however, it fails.</p><p>Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji come into view in minutes, making their way up from Caiyi Village. That was a long shopping trip if he’s ever seen one. Doesn’t seem very successful either – neither one of them is carrying any bags – but then Jiang Cheng knows better than to think that means anything. He was the unfortunate victim of one of Wei Wuxian’s many pranks too often in his childhood to ever assume that his adopted brother is empty-handed.</p><p>“Hey! Jiang Cheng!”</p><p>An excited voice shouts his name loudly. Speak of the devil. There’s a smile on the other man’s face as he ascends the last few metres of he slope, an arm looped through his husband’s.</p><p>Jiang Cheng sighs a little inside. It’s times like this he feels his bachelorhood acutely. They’re so fucking <em>perfect</em> together. Wei Wuxian with his effervescence and sunny personality, Lan Wangji with his stoicism and his touch-my-partner-and-I’ll-fuck-you-up attitude. <em>Damn</em>.</p><p>It’s enough to put the scowl back on his face, dragging it out from wherever it’s been hibernating for these past few hours. Lan Xichen’s presence may be calming, but Lan Wangji certainly is not.</p><p>Somebody shoves something into his free hand. It’s round and waxy, and when he looks up, Wei Wuxian is grinning and biting into a persimmon. There is juice running down his chin, all over his hands. Lan Wangji wordlessly removes a handkerchief and passes it to him.</p><p>“C’mon,” he says, around a mouthful of fruit. “Eat it.”</p><p>He waggles his eyebrows. “You know you want to.”</p><p>Instead, Jiang Cheng slips the persimmon into a pocket in his robes. He wonders if Wei Wuxian remembers that persimmons are his favourite. Then he holds the rabbit out to Lan Wangji, who shows no sign of surprise that another sect leader has wound up with one of his pets.</p><p>“Tell Lan Jingyi to be more careful when babysitting.”</p><p>He nearly laughs when Wei Wuxian almost chokes. And it’s not breaking his promise not to rat out the young disciple – all he promised to do was keep Lan Qiren from finding out where he was hiding. Anyway, it’s Hanguang-Jun’s rabbit.</p><p>Footsteps sound from somewhere nearby, and Jin Ling appears out of nowhere, dragging a reluctant Lan Sizhui behind him. His nephew’s face is flushed and the other disciple’s forehead ribbon is askew – what is up with those things? – so Jiang Cheng takes it to mean that congratulations are in order for later.</p><p>Another man would probably be concerned that he’s raised a boy who very obviously likes other boys, but honestly, Jiang Cheng couldn’t care less at this point. He’s already got one cut-sleeve in the family; what’s another? If the kid’s never going to have any heirs, well, that’s the Lanling Jin sect’s problem. As long as Jin Ling is happy.</p><p>He supposes he’ll have to give his nephew The Talk later. And another, different, talk might be in order for the Lan boy some other time. Possibly with Zidian out. Once he’s confirmed that <em>this</em> is the boy Jin Ling wants, of course – he only wants to have to do this once.</p><p>Jin Ling fixes the other disciple’s forehead ribbon so it’s no longer crooked, and Lan Sizhui goes even redder than before. Then they let go of each other’s hands (they’ve been holding hands this entire time <em>holy shit it’s serious</em>) and Jiang Cheng watches as they say their goodbyes. His nephew scuffs his boot against the floor while Lan Sizhui smiles gently, and he can’t help but be reminded of a man in the same white-and-blue uniform with a similar smile on his face.</p><p>It was sadder, though, than the one Jin Ling is staring at like it holds the whole world. He’s glad the children have the chance to find happiness for themselves. Hopefully they won’t make the same mistakes as their elders, or have to face the same hardships.</p><p>Finally, he and and his nephew turn to leave. They must make an odd pair, he thinks as the Cloud Recesses slowly disappear from view: a tall man dressed all in purple, and a young boy in gold.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has his regrets, he knows, and one of them is Jin Ling. But if he had to choose his greatest achievement, that would be Jin Ling too.</p>

He's super morally gray and does a lot of bad things, though he does have reasons (usually not good ones).<br/>Personally, I like his character because he's so interesting from an ethical and psychological standpoint - he did terrible things to get and stay in power (e.g. killing his own sworn brother, his son etc.), but he also did some really cool stuff with that power once he had it, mostly to help the common people most other cultivators like him tended to overlook (exhibit A: the watchtowers).<br/>I could talk about this for ages but I'm going to stop here before I bore you all to death.</p>

    <p>It is only when the sky is dark and Jiang Cheng is safely in his bed that the nightmares come. These days, they are his constant companions, but somehow they are worse whenever he leaves Lotus Pier, as though the comfort of home wards off some of it.</p><p>In his dreams, he is always younger.</p><p>Not for him the grisly visions of future possibilities that seem to plague others in the night and leave them shaking when they wake; his past is horrifying enough. His dreams are made all the worse for the fact that they have, in fact, happened, and are not just imaginary horrors that disappear with the morning light.</p><p>Tonight, he dreams of the night Lotus Pier burned to the ground, the night he lost his parents.</p><p>
  <em>He is seventeen and shivering with cold and the aftershocks of the lightning from his mother’s whip. No, it’s his now – she pressed it into his hand and told him to run before she turned to face the fierce men with the sun on their robes and death in their eyes. He and his brother are crouched in the shadows behind a charred wall in the burnt-out husk of what used to be his home.</em>
</p><p><em>There are bodies piled as far as the eye can see and even higher, covered in their own blood and entrails, all dressed in the purple robes that are so familiar to him. The same robes that he wears, even now. He recognises some of their faces: Ming Ru, who loved </em>tangyuan<em>, little Wang Song from the village, who raced with the bigger boys even though he came dead last every time…</em></p><p>
  <em>They were people, once. People he’s seen every day since he was a child – children who played with him, servants who advised his father, instructors who helped his mother train the disciples in the courtyard.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He watches the Wen dogs as they drag the bodies across that same courtyard, looks on as they toss torches on the piles of dead flesh and rags that go up in smoke. There is nothing that they have not destroyed. He wants to scream for them to stop, but his brother’s hand is over his mouth, and he finds he can’t make a sound.</em>
</p><p><em>Then Wen Zhuliu, the worst of them all – he knows what he’s doing is wrong, that traitor, why doesn’t he </em>stop<em> – kicks another corpse, and it turns over so Jiang Cheng can see its face. </em></p><p>
  <em>It’s his mother, and he suddenly notices his father’s dead body, kneeling on the floor in a pose he recognises as the one they use to pray to the ancestors during funerals. His hands are outstretched towards his wife, but there is no sign of love in either of their faces because all that is there is the slackness of death.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Jiang Cheng has wished all his life that his parents would stop fighting, but now, he would give anything in the world for them to scream at each other again. For his mother’s eyes to blaze with fury, for his father to storm out of the room.</em>
</p><p><em>That bastard Wen Chao kneels down and spits on his father’s corpse, and Jiang Cheng isn’t even afraid anymore. He should be. He’s surrounded by enemies stronger than he is with only his brother as backup, his home is in ruins, half of his family is </em>gone<em> and he should be shaking from fear as well as cold but all he feels is anger.</em></p><p>
  <em>There is fire in his veins but it feels like ice and burns the same way. All he can see is the bodies of his family, his friends, his loved ones, and the people who murdered them looming over them like they’re fucking proud of what they’ve done. </em>
</p><p><em>How dare they? How dare they take what was never theirs? How </em>dare <em>these monsters come into his sect and destroy his place and slaughter his people?</em></p><p>
  <em>He vows vengeance.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>If they do not fear the sun, he will teach them to fear the lightning. He will massacre them as those dogs have massacred his people. He will burn their homes as they have burned his. For every drop of blood they have shed, they will pay. For every life they have taken, they will pay.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Nothing can keep him from this.</em>
</p><p>He wakes drenched in sweat, the covers tangled around his ankles, a hand over his own mouth. His breaths thunder loud in the silence of the room.</p><p>Outside his window, Lotus Pier sits hale and whole as it has been these past thirteen years. It looks just like it used to before, because he <em>insisted</em> they recreate it exactly during the rebuilding process. The only fires are the tiny flames dancing in the lanterns along the river, but he can taste ashes on his tongue, can smell the scent of burning flesh like so much cooked pork. It takes everything he has not to throw up.</p><p>The freezing fire is still in his veins, pumping through him with every beat of his heart. Familiar, like an old friend, or a cherished companion. People are fickle, but the anger has never abandoned him, and it never will.</p><p>He pushes down the sadness that always comes with the memories, grasps hold of the fury instead. Then he throws on his outer robes over the thin white inner ones he wears to sleep, knots the tie at the front securely to keep them from opening, and picks up Sandu from where the sword lies on his bedside table, within easy reach if he ever needs it during the night.</p><p>The door swings shut soundlessly behind him. The hinges are kept oiled specifically for this reason. Jiang Cheng never sleeps past four in the morning – his nightmares don’t let him – but everyone else needs their rest, especially if he wants a fully functioning sect during the day.</p><p>The air is cool as he makes his way down to the practice yards. It’s the tail end of January, the beginning of spring, so while the weather is nowhere near warm, it’s getting there. (Too fucking slowly, in his opinion.)</p><p>No one else is ever up at this hour, so the only sounds are his footsteps on the flagstones as he reaches the corner where the practice dummies are set up. Nothing fancy, just straw-stuffed potato sacks with wooden arms and legs, as well as a thick pole in the centre to keep its torso and head in place. Mostly the older disciples use them for sword exercises, to hone their skills at striking a target; it shows in the numerous patched-over holes in the cloth where straw bits poke through.</p><p>He chooses a clear patch of floor in the centre of a circle of dummies, and begins to warm up. First, he starts with the simple drills, combinations of three or more basic moves that every disciple is required to master in their first year of training. His body moves through the familiar forms, the moonlight glinting off the surface of Sandu’s blade.</p><p>Without a fire or even a blazing torch, there is little light to see by, but Jiang Cheng’s night vision is better than most, and he became accustomed to fighting in the dark during the Sunshot Campaign, where he participated in his share of night skirmishes.</p><p>He finishes this set and moves on to the next, slightly more complicated one. The motions come easily, more so than when he first memorized them as a teenager, and he finishes quickly, going onto the next set, and the next.</p><p>The fire inside him blazes higher as he thrusts and parries, darts forward and backwards and side-to-side in a dizzying flurry of moves that seems like a dance. The world narrows to his body and the sword in his hand, striking out at an imaginary opponent as his pulse pounds in his ears and his muscles burn with the sweet exertion of the fight. Another few sets and Zidian joins the fray, arcing through the air as it sends out tendrils of deadly violet lightning.</p><p>Jiang Cheng loves this, the battle-thrill singing in his veins. Each move turns that rage inside him into a weapon deadlier than Sandu, and for a moment as he’s fighting, it feels like something close to joy.</p><p>He knows the names that get whispered behind his back. How could he not? <em>Torturer. Murderer. Madman.</em></p><p>His reputation was established during the Sunshot Campaign, where he left fields full of corpses in his wake; some gutted and bleeding out as they struggled vainly to keep their intestines inside themselves, others screaming as they clutched at the charred stumps of limbs he’d seared off with his whip, and still more who’d seen their comrades slaughtered in front of them and had run themselves through with their own fucking blades rather than face him.</p><p>People called him insane because of his bloodlust and the crazed grin on his face as he cut down swathes of soldiers on the opposite side. He thinks he might be mad, too, because he knows what he’s done is wrong. But it’s the only thing that makes the pain feel <em>good</em>.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="left"> </p><p>Miles away, Lan Huan can’t sleep either.</p><p>Members of the Gusu Lan sect are famous for their strict sleeping schedules and impeccable biological clocks: they go to bed at exactly nine o’ clock, and wake up at precisely five the next morning.</p><p>If one were to lock a Lan in a windowless room for a long period of time, said Lan would still be able to know exactly how many days had passed since the beginning of their imprisonment by their cycles of sleeping and waking. Many count this among the strange and impressive abilities possessed by members of their clan, such as marathon handstands, stellar poker faces, and committing murder with <em>guqin</em> strings as their only weapons.</p><p>It is one of the constants of the universe. The sun rises in the east; a Lan sleeps eight hours.</p><p>Lately, though, Lan Huan has been having trouble sticking to this habit ingrained in him since childhood. He lies awake in his bed for hours, unable to drift off. When he does, he sleeps fitfully, until the dreams that disturb his slumber claw him back into wakefulness.</p><p>It is just after one such cycle that Lan Huan finds himself at three in the morning, staring out the window at the waning moon. Barely a sliver of it is still visible; in another few nights it will disappear completely.</p><p>His nightmares aren’t always the same. Most often, he dreams about his sworn brothers – the crazed look on Nie Mingjue’s face as he flew into his killing rage and was then summarily put down like a dog that had bitten one person too many, the shock and betrayal (but also a kind of resignation) in Jin Guangyao’s eyes when Lan Huan ran him through with his sword.</p><p>Those nights are the worst, because they bring up every painful feeling he squashes down during the day, as if his subconscious is taking revenge for the constant suppression by lashing out at night when his guard is down.</p><p>Other times, he dreams of things he’d thought were far behind him. His father’s death, his own desperate flight from the Cloud Recesses, carrying the books that were the true treasures of their sect. Sometimes his childhood makes a reappearance: leading Wangji by the hand as they twisted through the corridors that now separate him from the outside world, in search of the parents they rarely got to see.</p><p>If this is what he sees when he closes his eyes, he would rather keep them open.</p><p>He forces himself to think about other things, before he gets drawn past the event horizon into that black hole from which there is no escape. If he begins to recall, if he begins to remember, he’ll never stop – he’ll live forever in the past he could not change. And then what use will he be to anybody?</p><p><em>What use are you to anyone right now, </em>part of him asks sarcastically. The question cuts deep, and he shoves it back inside the little room in his head that he reserves for the things he can’t think about. Closes the door and locks it, and realises that the room isn’t so little anymore.</p><p>The air inside his bedroom is suddenly stifling, but he doesn’t get out of bed. Instead, he shuts his eyes tight and turns over on his side. Because he is a Lan, and Lans get up at five in the morning, and this is just about the last bit of his identity left that he can be sure of.</p>

    <p>By the time the sun comes up over Lotus Pier, Jiang Cheng is done taking out his frustrations on the straw-filled practice dummies and is ready to start the day. He’s bathed, changed and made himself presentable, and is now in his office, tackling a worryingly tall stack of papers perched precariously on the edge of his desk.</p><p>Sandu is within easy reach, of course, though it’s not likely to see any use. Gods, had being sect leader involved this much paperwork when his father was running things? He does have to admit this is partially his own fault for being out all day yesterday; he’d gotten very little done, and now he’s paying the price.</p><p>Breakfast is a rushed affair, brought in by a servant who scurries out of the room again once the tray touches the table. It puts him in an even worse mood, and he glares harder at the papers in front of him. He knows the help are all afraid of his famous temper, but do they have to be so damn <em>obvious</em> about it? It’s not like he’s going to bite their heads off for nothing.</p><p>(He pointedly does <em>not</em> think about the time he spent ten minutes yelling at a servant because he’d broken his concentration while he was engaged in writing a letter to Nie Huaisang. The man had started crying five minutes in.)</p><p>Jiang Cheng eats while he writes, careful to keep any crumbs or spills off the pristine official documents. The breaks between mouthfuls are punctuated by the occasional curse as he reads a letter written by a particularly idiotic individual.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Jiang Cheng doesn’t spend all his time in grand, mysterious meetings with the leaders of the four great clans. Part of his job as sect leader is liaising with the heads of the tiny villages all over Yunmeng, understanding their woes and helping them fix their problems. Sometimes the issues are important, affecting the general wellbeing of a significant number of his people, like the drought that is currently plaguing one of the western villages, or the cattle famine that struck a number of the more central towns six years ago. Other times, however…</p><p>He mutters an oath under his breath as he reads a missive lamenting the unusually high number of same-sex marriages that have been taking place lately in a farming village. Yes, he knows this is going to affect the birth rate and possibly the amount of food they can produce later on, but what the <em>fuck</em> is he supposed to do about it?</p><p>Waltz in there and demand that they all sign divorce papers? Not bloody likely.</p><p>Fucking idiots, these people.</p><p>As the day wears on, a throbbing pain begins to build between his temples. It’s not an unusual occurrence, especially on the days he spends reading letters and composing responses, and as headaches go, it’s not too bad. He’s had worse, so he ignores it.</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean it goes away, and his temper steadily worsens leading into the afternoon. The servants all notice, obviously – they’re the ones who have to clean up the mess when he starts throwing things. He’s careful not to break anything <em>too</em> expensive, though.</p><p>Finally – fucking finally! – he’s done for the day. His mail is in three neat piles: things he’s read and might need later, letters he’s written that he’ll get someone to send out this evening, and stuff he does not need and will absolutely never need ever again, which he is only too happy to let the help cart off to be incinerated.</p><p>Jiang Cheng stands up, pushing his chair back and shaking his right hand to rid himself of the cramps he gets when he’s been writing too long.</p><p>Now, onto the next order of business. He is absolutely <em>not </em>looking forward to this. Yesterday’s promise to himself rings in his ears again, taunting. There are some things single uncles should never have to say to their nephews, and the talk he’s told himself he’ll give is one of those things. This should be Jin Zixuan’s job, damnit. For the umpteenth time, he curses the bastard for dying so young.</p><p>Who the hell decided he was qualified for this, anyway? He can’t even get a fucking date – <em>Jin Ling</em>’s got a leg up on him there.</p><p>Oh, well. The kid has to hear this from somebody; it might as well be him. He shudders to think of what would happen if he allowed the boy’s other uncle, Wei Wuxian, to shoulder this responsibility.</p><p>Idly, he wonders who does it for the Gusu Lan sect disciples – Lan Qiren? Now <em>that</em> is a great mental image. If he has to say, he thinks Lan Xichen would be the best person for the job. The man is just so calm and approachable.</p><p>Jiang Cheng steers his thoughts back on topic. The longer he puts this off, the harder it’s going to be.</p><p><em>Alright, man up</em>, he tells himself. <em>Don’t chicken out like a wuss</em>.</p><p>He grabs Sandu like he’s heading into battle (that would actually be preferable at this point) and marches out of the room, his robes swirling behind him.</p><p>It takes him barely any time at all to find Jin Ling. His nephew is, predictably, outside at the archery range. Though he’s inherited his father’s ridiculously fancy sword, the bow seems to be Jin Ling’s favourite weapon. It makes sense in a way – it lets him stand back and shoot at things that annoy him from a safe distance.</p><p>“Jin Ling!”, he barks.</p><p>The kid’s next shot is off, hitting the outer ring of the target with a ‘thunk’. He drops the bow and turns around, his eyes wide and arms crossed defensively over his chest.</p><p>“I didn’t do anything, Uncle. I swear!” Jin Ling protests automatically, but Jiang Cheng cuts him off.</p><p>“I don’t have time to hear this. We need to talk.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Just minutes later, the two of them are sitting in Jiang Cheng’s quarters. He’s decided the office is too formal for the things they need to discuss. He’d rather not do this in Jin Ling’s room either, so his nephew can’t kick him out if he gets too embarrassed. He has ridiculously thin skin, that kid.</p><p>“What did you want to talk to me about?” There’s a pout on Jin Ling’s face. He’s not going to make this easy, is he?</p><p>“What’s your relationship with Lan Sizhui?”, he returns. Jin Ling splutters indignantly and turns beet-red, and Jiang Cheng gives him a look that says <em>I can see through your bullshit. Don’t fucking test me</em>.</p><p>“W-we… he’s… we’re…”</p><p>Jiang Cheng resists the urge to bury his head in his hands. This is just painful.</p><p>“Alright, alright, I get the picture. Now, how far have you gone?”</p><p>The flush on his nephew’s face reaches epic proportions. He makes a noise like he’s choking, and Jiang Cheng resists a deeply-buried urge from years ago to pat him on the back to make sure he can breathe. Instead, he narrows his eyes.</p><p>“Answer the goddamn question, Jin Ling.”</p><p>A few seconds later, the boy manages to get something out that sounds vaguely like human speech. But Jiang Cheng doesn’t speak ‘mumbling teenager’, so he snaps at the boy to speak up.</p><p>He’s not looking at his uncle when he says, “um… we’ve kissed a couple times.”</p><p><em>Praise every god and goddess in the heavens</em>. This could have been <em>infinitely</em> more awkward.</p><p>“Congratulations,” he says tersely. Jin Ling’s head snaps up. His mouth hangs open and he’s gaping like a fish. Jiang Cheng lets the word hang in the air for a few more moments, savouring the look on his nephew’s face. It’s the only remotely enjoyable thing about this situation. Then he continues.</p><p>“I assume you know what comes after?” His tone is sardonic, but inside he’s praying that the anwer is yes. It would be just his luck that Jin Ling is the only sixteen-year-old boy in the world who hasn’t yet figured out how sex works.</p><p>Thankfully, the kid nods. This is getting more uncomfortable by the minute. For both of them.</p><p>“Okay, kid, listen up. I’m only going to say this once.” Jiang Cheng desperately hopes that’s true. “There are three things I’m going to tell you, and you better remember them, because if you forget, you’re the one getting screwed over.”</p><p>“One: don’t <em>ever</em> let anyone pressure you into doing something you’re not comfortable with. Especially your first time. Tell whoever it is you’re with to stop, and don’t take ‘no’ for an answer. Hit them if you have to.”</p><p>Jin Ling is looking at him with an expression that holds a mixture of awe and horror, like he’s watching two horse-riders going full speed crash into each other before someone inevitably breaks their neck. This is a fucking disaster, is what it is, but he hopes at least some of this information makes its way past Jin Ling’s thick skull.</p><p>“Two: take your damn time. It’s not a race – make sure everyone’s having a good time before you do anything. If the other person wants to stop, you stop. If both of you want to go ahead, go slow. Trying to rush things is how people get hurt.”</p><p>“Three: make very, <em>very</em> sure both you and your partner are safe. There are some diseases that can be transmitted that way if you’re not careful, and some of them are nasty. You might ignore it now, but you’ll regret it later. How do you think your grandfather died? Let me tell you, it wasn’t a fucking cold. He had women all over the place; picked up all kinds of shit. He got sloppy, and it killed him.”</p><p>His nephew’s eyes go wide at <em>that</em> little detail. The official story was that Jin Guangshan had died of an infection, and that’s what most people believed. But as a sect leader, Jiang Cheng is privy to all sorts of information others would love to keep secret. Including the business of other sect leaders.</p><p>He knows this might be going a little overboard, but scaring the kid straight has worked for him so far. Maybe if Jin Ling knows this kind of thing has consequences, he’ll be more inclined to listen.</p><p>“Got it?”, he asks. Jin Ling nods wordlessly.</p><p>“Any questions?”</p><p>Emphatic head shaking follows.</p><p>“Good,” he says gruffly. “Good talk. Now we can both pretend this never happened and move on with our lives.”</p><p>Jin Ling takes that for the implied dismissal it is and escapes from the room so fast it’s like his feet are on fire. Jiang Cheng doesn’t blame him; he hates to imagine what it would do to his reputation if this ever got out.</p><p>To be honest, he was flying by the seat of his pants throughout the entire conversation. Confession time: Jiang Cheng is even more of a virgin than his nephew, given that he’s never had a girlfriend, or even a date that lasted more than fifteen minutes.</p><p>If that’s not fucking tragic, he doesn’t know what is. Actually, it’s more pathetic than anything else.</p><p>What more confirmation does he need that no one will ever want him?</p><p>He knows it’s his fault. There’s something wrong with him; always has been. He knows he’s an asshole, and not the good kind, either – the kind whose flaws people can overlook because their virtues outweigh their bad qualities. He’s rude and caustic and more than a little paranoid, yells too much and smiles too little, and there are whole parts of him that nobody in their right mind would touch with a ten-foot pole.</p><p>Jiang Cheng is the leader of one of the four great sects and rich as sin. One of the most powerful men in the world, and even that can’t tempt anyone into putting up with him for half a fucking hour.</p><p>Yesterday was the first time in years that he’d been able to be around another person who wasn’t either related or bound to him by ties of service or politics. He resolutely does not think about how Lan Xichen’s smile made him feel (it’s been so long since he’s had an expression like that directed at him).</p><p>It couldn’t last, anyway. Zewu-Jun is in seclusion, cut off from the outside world. It was only an accident that they were able to meet at all, and that set of circumstances is not likely to happen ever again. But that’s not the main reason.</p><p>It couldn’t last, because sooner or later, Jiang Cheng drives everyone away.</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The next few days are rather uneventful – or as much as they can be when one is living with a sullen teenager. Jin Ling has been avoiding his uncle like the plague, shuttling between the archery range and his room, where he locks himself in like a hermit crab and refuses to come out. Jiang Cheng doesn’t think the boy has fully recovered from the embarrassment yet.</p><p>Other than that, however, business is as usual around Lotus Pier. Jiang Cheng’s waking hours are filled with reports to be filed, people to meet, and one on occasion, a night-hunt in a nearby fishing village to get rid of a particularly stubborn water ghoul. He goes alone on that one, and feels much better after unleashing his pent-up frustration on the poor unsuspecting corpses in the lake.</p><p>He is a busy man these days, which leaves him little time to brood. It’s a nice change. Exhaustion takes him when the day is done, and the nightmares come less frequently. He dreams less about fire and blood – an aching loneliness takes their place, but he’s familiar with that. He can deal.</p><p>A letter arrives with the rest of his mail one Friday morning after breakfast. It is much like the rest, sealed in a plain white envelope. The paper inside, however, is rather fine and officious-looking.</p><p>The maid who brings in the mail every morning passes the letter to Jiang Cheng, who closes his long fingers around it.</p><p>“It’s from Gusu, sir,” she says respectfully. Jiang Cheng frowns, unfolding the paper. Indeed, it has been sent from the Cloud Recesses, addressed to ‘<em>Sect Leader Jiang Wanyin</em>’. The sender’s name is inked in perfect, flowing black calligraphy. Lan Qiren.</p><p>That unfortunately means he can’t send this letter straight to the trash. What could the acting Gusu Lan sect leader want? With some difficulty, he recalls Lan Qiren’s words to him during his and Jin Ling’s brief visit only a few days ago.</p><p><em>…</em> <em>several crucial letters, one of which was to have gone to Yunmeng.</em></p><p>Was this one of the ‘important documents’ Lan Jingyi (and that troublesome rabbit) had ruined? He decides to read on. If Lan Qiren thinks it’s important, it must be.</p><p>The letter is nearly four pages long, printed on both sides in the other man’s neat script. He skims through it once to catch the gist of it, then reads it again – more slowly this time – to sieve out the important details.</p><p>The first page is mostly pleasantries, thanking Jiang Cheng for taking the time to read this correspondence and apologising for any disturbances to his schedule. Naturally, he regards it with suspicion.</p><p>It sounds like he’s being buttered up for something, and a sinking feeling in his stomach tells him he’s probably not going to be happy about it.</p><p>Then he gets to the second page – the meat of the letter. His suspicions are confirmed as he reads on, and his head begins to ache again.</p><p>Lan Qiren is requesting his presence in the Cloud Recesses in two days for a gathering of sect leaders. The others have all been sent for, including Nie Huaisang and the old advisor who is standing in for Jin Ling as the head of the Lanling Jin sect until the brat comes of age. Jiang Cheng has, however, been asked to bring Jin Ling anyway, in order for him to meet with the rest and familiarise himself with the workings of inter-sect politics.</p><p>There will be a series of meetings over the course of a week, mostly having to do with relations between their respective clans – even the smaller houses will be involved. Lan Qiren is calling for unity, apparently. The objective of the gathering is supposedly to discuss future partnerships and alliances, to strengthen all the sects as a whole.</p><p><em>All of the clans must stand united,</em> the letter concludes. <em>A mere fifteen years have passed since the Sunshot Campaign. We must not allow something like it to come to pass once more; much of the damage both during and since could have been minimised if every one of our great houses had stood together to combat the threats that faced us all. I hope you will consider this proposal; not solely for the good of one sect, but for the good of all.</em></p><p>When he comes to the end of the letter for the third time, Jiang Cheng puts the paper down and gives a rude snort. Not fucking likely. It’s admittedly a good idea, all the sects working together and getting along, but this is real life, not some rose-tinted fantasy world with unicorns that shit rainbows.</p><p>The sect leaders are a bunch of rich, entitled assholes, most of them over eighty and so sunken in their ways that they wouldn’t notice a new idea if someone clobbered them over the head with it. The only thing that’ll happen at this gathering is a great deal of shouting, as every man tries to negotiate a better deal for himself and his own sect.</p><p>Alliances are all well and good, but while everyone likes the thought of having someone else come to their aid in times of trouble, people are decidedly more reluctant when it’s them risking their necks for an outsider.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, the sects did unite against the Qishan Wen clan (that name still makes his blood boil, even inside his own head). But that was a unique case; all of them were being threatened, and they needed every bit of manpower they could muster to protect themselves from the enemy.</p><p>Self-interest is a very powerful motivator. Without it, however, they have absolutely no hope of getting anything done. Lan Qiren is an idiot if he thinks otherwise. Or maybe the stress of running the Gusu Lan sect for thirty years has finally driven him senile.</p><p>Jiang Cheng sighs and picks up a fresh piece of paper anyway. He can’t refuse an invitation from another sect leader – not without looking rude – and if there’s one thing those stuffy asses in Cloud Recesses set great store by, it’s manners.</p><p>He might as well see how this all plays out. It’s not like he’s got much else better to do.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lan Huan is out in the garden again. Since the day Sect Leader Jiang crashed into his quiet, peaceful bubble holding a rabbit and cursing up a storm, he’s pruned every flower bush twice over, replanted some of the bamboo saplings on the north side of the cottage, and removed several large clumps of duckweed that had started to take over the pond. He’s also practiced his handstands and sword work, cleaned and re-cleaned his house, and spent hours every day plucking the strings of his <em>guqin</em> trying to find a melody that doesn’t sound mournful.</p><p>Still, he’s been restless for the past few days.</p><p>The pond behind the cottage is as beautiful as ever, but sitting by it alone feels strangely… empty, now that he knows how it feels to sit by it with someone else. There’s a part of him that seems to have woken up, that can’t sit still anymore, not even when he meditates and tries to calm down.</p><p><em>Calm</em>. It’s what he’s always been good at. It’s what his family is good at – remaining stoic and unflappable no matter the situation. Oh, they all go about it in different ways: his uncle with his strict demeanor, Wangji with his blank expressions that few others can read – even little Sizhui, who’s learned to keep his emotions under control. Lan Huan himself uses a beatific smile to portray an unruffled exterior to the world.</p><p>Even going into seclusion was supposed to be a way to help him regain his inner tranquility. The sameness of every day, the lack of external disruptions, the absence of other people: a recipe for a peaceful environment.</p><p>But for some reason, Lan Huan can no longer sink into the peaceful trance he used to put himself in to go about his day. Every sight, every sound, every smell is jarring. Everything reminds him of the way the world felt when he used to experience it with other people.</p><p>Is his calm really so fragile, that just a single visit from one unexpected person is enough to shatter it? He should be able to go back to his quiet, repetitive routine, but he can’t. And this is what discomfits him most of all.</p><p>A shift in the air and the sound of footsteps breaks his reverie. Lan Huan’s little brother stands at the entrance to his secluded space, just in front of the corridor that leads to it. His hands are clasped together at his front, hidden by the ends of his long sleeves.</p><p>Anyone else would say that Lan Wangji looks expressionless, as usual, but Lan Huan can tell that his brother is happy to see him.</p><p>It’s not difficult, really; Wangji has emotions just like anyone else, feels things just as fiercely, if not more so, for all that he hides them behind a blank mask. All it takes to unearth that storm of emotion is to look a little deeper, but so few bother to do so. It is sad that people are so shallow.</p><p>The look Wangji is giving him right now, for instance, is easy to read. The slight, almost imperceptible uptilt of the corners of his mouth, the smoothening of some of the shallow furrows around his brows – all of that says that his younger brother is <em>pleased</em> to see him.</p><p>“Welcome back,” says Lan Huan, smiling gently. The other man nods, and the two of them move into the little cottage.</p><p>The house’s layout is simple: two rooms – a bedroom and a large space someone else might call a living room – furnished with a small, well-stocked kitchen. Lan Huan keeps ingredients there, of course, and he cooks his own food. He’d learned the skill when Meng Yao had taken him in, back when he was on the run from the Wen clan.</p><p>It was about the only thing he’d been able to do to repay his host. He was hopeless at washing clothes, and Meng Yao had been too particular about the positions of each and every one of his few things to allow Lan Huan to clean his rooms.</p><p>He carefully tamps down the thing in his chest that twinges whenever his traitorous mind brings up Meng Yao. Not Jin Guangyao, or Lianfang-Zun, as he came to be known later on, but the boy from the brothel who’d opened his home up to a stranger lying half-dead on the side of the road.</p><p>Wangji has been inside these rooms often enough to be familiar with the layout, so he barely looks at his surroundings as they move into Lan Huan’s living room and sit down on a straw mat. His light golden eyes stay focused on his older brother, watching him as if to discern any emotion that deviates from the norm.</p><p>“How is everything in Gusu?”, prompts the elder of the two. He may have gone into seclusion, but he likes to stay abreast of the current happenings elsewhere. If a true emergency arises, he will re-enter society in a heartbeat. The needs of his people come before his personal desires, always.</p><p>But Wangji has little to tell him. The only thing of interest he conveys is that Lan Qiren has invited all the sect leaders to Cloud Recesses for a gathering on inter-sect diplomacy.</p><p>“That is very intriguing indeed.” Lan Huan pauses for a second to think it over. “I only hope it goes well. If it works, it could mean greater unity.”</p><p>And a stronger, more cohesive cultivation world. Hasn’t that been his dream all these years? It was one of the reasons he and his two sworn brothers had decided to form the Venerated Triad. Nie Mingjue, the leader of the Qinghe Nie sect; Jin Guangyao, head of the Lanling Jin sect; and himself, the Gusu Lan sect leader. They were to look out for each other and all of their sects, not just their own.</p><p><em>Look how that turned out</em>, a voice whispers in his ear. Lan Huan does his best to ignore it. His own failures shouldn’t stand in the way of a brighter future. Especially not with something so important.</p><p>“It was Wei Ying’s idea,” says Wangji, looking rather smug. Lan Huan can guess who passed it on to their uncle, then. He’s not surprised, honestly; the one-time Yiling Patriarch is full of ideas, and many of them are good ones.</p><p>“How is he, by the way?”, he asks, trying to sound nonchalant. When his baby brother answers with a “good”, he looks happier than Lan Huan has ever seen him.</p><p>Married life seems to agree with Wangji. There is a glow to his features, and his eyes are much brighter now. There is little left in him of the dead-eyed man who had replaced Lan Huan’s brother in the thirteen years after Wei Wuxian was killed at Luanzang-Gang. That man had carried nothing but misery and bitterness, and he’d been so cold Lan Huan had wondered if his heart had frozen.</p><p>The Wangji of the present is much milder. He is calmer even than he used to be as a child. In his teenage years, a single instance of rule-breaking was enough to drive him to draw Bichen and challenge someone to a duel. Now, he simply glares until the offending party submit, trembling in their boots.</p><p>It is as if the coldness of those thirteen years has dimmed the flames inside him. The boy with the fiery temper is now slow to anger, and when he does, the raging inferno of his youth has been replaced with an icy chill.</p><p>It scares Lan Huan a bit. How could it not? This is his baby brother, the little boy he’d held when he was having nightmares, when he asked in a broken voice why their parents never wanted to see them. Since he fell in love with Wei Wuxian, so much about Wangji has changed.</p><p>Lan Huan wonders how much of it was unconscious on his part, and how much was an effort to mold himself into the kind of person he believed Wei Wuxian would want. Loss changes people, alters them irreversibly, but Lan Huan is afraid his brother may have lost too much of himself in an effort to get back the person he loves.</p><p>He won’t voice that fear, though. Wangji looks too happy, too contented, and he can’t bring himself to spoil the mood. Instead, he tells the other man about Jiang Wanyin’s out-of-the-blue arrival, and the pleasant afternoon where they sat together by the pond and fed the ducks.</p><p>His brother listens intently, obviously interested by the story, though his brow furrows and his eyes narrow whenever Sandu-Shengshou’s name is mentioned. Lan Huan knows Wangji dislikes the other sect leader, whether it’s for his prickly demeanor or his tumultuous relationship with Wei Wuxian. The Second Jade of Gusu Lan is borderline territorial when it comes to his husband, which seems rather unhealthy and is yet another reason for Lan Huan to worry.</p><p>He pushes it to the back of his mind. He spends far too little time with his younger brother as it is; he’d rather not waste any of it thinking about things he can’t control.</p><p>For now, he relishes one of Wangji’s rare smiles as he describes the trouble-making rabbit and the short, heart-attack inducing period he and Jiang Wanyin spent madly searching for it in the flower bushes. It is blinding and so, so beautiful and he thinks he would give anything in the world to keep his brother smiling like that. Worries and all.</p>

          <p>So, about Lan Xichen's little angst-fest at the end of the chapter: he doesn't actually dislike Wei Wuxian. He's just worried for his little brother, and while he likes that Wei Wuxian makes him happy, he's not entirely comfortable with the dynamics of their relationship.<br/>This sort of stems from my own opinion of our protagonist. I'm not the biggest fan of Wei Wuxian - I have a few issues with his character and actions, but I don't hate him. In fact, he's rather enjoyable to read; I just don't have the same love for him that I do for other characters like Jiang Cheng, Lan Xichen and Lan Jingyi.<br/>Nevertheless, I will do my very best to treat his character fairly while I address some of the thoughts I have as well. There will not, I repeat: THERE WILL NOT be any character-bashing. All of the characters are very nuanced and well-written and deserve better than hate.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you guys enjoyed today's chapter. The plot seems to be picking up, and THERE WILL BE DRAMA. It's extra-long because I don't think there will be one tomorrow. I'm going to the dentist and won't have that much time to write. There will also be a short hiatus next week from Thursday til Monday, I believe, but I will update afterwards, as per usual. I'm going to Malaysia to play softball! YAY!!!!</p><p>You can come scream at me on Tumblr about MoDaoZuShi as well as my other fandoms (like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Supernatural, Game of Thrones, ZhenHun etc.) at messenger18reaper (my account name). I don't post often, but I'll reply to any messages you send. In case you were wondering, I do have a Wattpad account from when I was fourteen, but it's terribly embarrassing. Hope you enjoy the rest of the weekend!</p>

    <p>He was right. This is going to be a fucking disaster. It’s five in the morning, and Jiang Cheng is cranky as hell, because he hasn’t had time to do the sword exercises he’s accustomed to completing before he starts the day. And to top that all off, he’s had to wake up at two, which is a bit much even for a chronic insomniac like him.</p><p>Jin Ling is no better. Anyone who says youths have more energy and are more adaptable is clearly on something, because teenagers – especially sixteen-year-olds who apparently “need their beauty sleep” or some shit – have to get their eight hours to turn themselves into anything resembling functional human beings.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s nephew is currently glaring at the world through half-closed bleary eyes, while a crowd of people bustles around him, scrambling to get the last preparations in order for their visit to Cloud Recesses. The man himself almost feels sorry for them, since they’re up well before dawn as well, undoubtedly disrupting their biological clocks.</p><p>That pity abruptly disappears when he remembers that most of them will be able to go back to sleep once he and Jin Ling are safely out of Lotus Pier. And considering the length of time they’ll be gone, those little shits will be able to slack off for a whole week without him here to yell at them. They’ll almost certainly be glad to see the back of him.</p><p>The past two days have been a flurry of activity. Jiang Cheng’s been run off his feet making arrangements for people to take over in his absence. While in Cloud Recesses, he will still get letters and correspondence from Yunmeng, of course, but he won’t be there in person to deal with the little details that crop up in day-to-day life.</p><p>There have been a couple times where he very nearly said <em>fuck it</em> and decided that if the sect can’t run itself for a week while he’s gone then it probably deserves to fall apart. But he always caught himself before he reached that point. The Jiang sect is far too important for that – besides, what would his father say if he knew what his son was thinking?</p><p>
    <em>Probably something about how I still don’t understand the spirit or the values of a proper sect leader.</em>
    </p><p>He sighs, then gets jarred out of his thoughts when someone tells him it’s time to go.</p><p>The preparations this time have been much more complex than the hasty ones involved in Jin Ling’s last-minute decision to go to Gusu, seeing as the latter was an informal visit to celebrate a friend’s birthday and this is an important diplomatic mission.</p><p>Of course he has to bring a damn doorgift.</p><p>Giving a curt nod to the staff as a goodbye, Jiang Cheng and Jin Ling begin their journey to the Cloud Recesses. Hopefully, nothing <em>too</em> disastrous will happen in the coming week and they’ll be able to return and resume life as per normal, Jiang Cheng thinks rather optimistically.</p><p>Famous last words.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>A few hours later – a short distance, really, considering that it can take days to travel to some of the other sects – the two of them are ascending the last bit of the mountain trail that ends at the Cloud Recesses. The buildings come swiftly into view, low blue-roofed structures painted a soft white that look like actual clouds, contrasting with the stark gray cliff wall covered with rows upon rows of neatly carved characters. The word ‘no’ is repeated so often it’s almost funny: no drinking, no shouting, no running…</p><p>The whole place looks exactly as it did when they left just a few days ago. Lan Qiren is standing near the entrance to receive them, as is custom when welcoming visiting dignitaries. Jin Ling is still barely half awake, but is aware enough to greet the Gusu Lan sect leader politely in return when the other man bows and utters a few pleasantries.</p><p>Jiang Cheng does the same, though his greeting is longer and much more formal. The older man looks annoyingly chipper despite his usual sombre expression, but then this is his home, Jiang Cheng thinks sourly. <em>He</em> didn’t have to get up at an ungodly hour and then spend nearly six hours on the road in order to arrive before midday. And anyway, everyone knows the Lans get up at five as a matter of course.</p><p>Waving an elegant hand, Lan Qiren beckons one of the older disciples in the blue-and-white robes of the Gusu Lan sect over. There is a brief exchange in muttered tones too low for Jiang Cheng to grasp, and then the disciple is leading him and Jin Ling towards one of the smaller buildings.</p><p>It is a low structure, perhaps two stories high, with a wide base and an elaborate peaked roof. Jiang Cheng has been here several times over the years – it’s a dormitory of sorts for visiting sect leaders. At its maximum capacity, it can house all twenty in sufficient comfort to appease even the peacocks from the Lanling Jin sect.</p><p>He suppresses a shudder. Given the blood that runs through his veins on his father’s side, it’s a small miracle that Jin Ling didn’t turn out that way.</p><p>In that respect, Jin Guangyao was actually the only tolerable one of the lot, probably due to his exceedingly humble beginnings as the son of a prostitute in one of the city’s more popular brothels.</p><p>The young disciple – from the looks of it, only about a year older than Jin Ling – shows them to what Jiang Cheng supposes must be their quarters. He stops outside the doorway, bows deeply and respectfully, and disappears without another word. Typical Lan behaviour.</p><p>Each of them has their own set of rooms, both tastefully decorated in the Lan colours of blue and white. <em>Are there only two colours in this godforsaken place?</em> All the sect leaders’ quarters look to be identical. Jiang Cheng grudgingly admits that this is a good idea: it symbolises that here, everyone is on equal ground, regardless of their own personal status or the strength of their sects. It bodes well for the meetings throughout the rest of the week – perhaps they’ll be able to accomplish something after all.</p><p>His and Jin Ling’s quarters are located adjacent to each other, and the wall separating them is thin enough to yell through if necessary. Jin Ling is predictably excited about having his own set of rooms. During previous visits long enough that staying over was necessary, he and his uncle always had to share due to his young age. Now that Jin Ling is older and about to become a sect leader, he is afforded greater courtesies because of this.</p><p>Jiang Cheng, too, is enjoying the extra freedom and space this allows him. He’ll still have to keep a close eye on his nephew to make sure he stays out of trouble, but it’s still preferable to sharing a room with a moody teenager for a week.</p><p>He remembers all too well the early days of the constant juggling between sect leader and father figure. Unwilling to drop the kid off at the Lanling Jin sect for his grandmother to spoil, he’d had to take him along to various meetings – and on a few memorable occasions, the annual inter-sect gatherings, the location of which shifted every year. Jin Ling had repeatedly kept him up half the night crying, unused to such unfamiliar surroundings, and the looks the other sect leaders gave him the next morning when he showed up to meetings with dark circles around his eyes and a baby in his arms…</p><p>It had dredged up old insecurities from his youth, fears that he was inadequate, a constant terror that he’d screw up somehow and make the Yunmeng Jiang sect the laughingstock of the cultivation world. Well, he’s glad all that’s over now.</p><p>Jiang Cheng opens the small case that he’s brought with him and begins to unpack. Clothes go in the modestly-sized closet in the bedroom; his toothbrush, comb and razor, he sets out on the short ledge near the sink in the toilet. He moves over to the tiny kitchen and does a quick inventory. It contains rice, fruit, vegetables, even a small amount of meat (chicken, mostly).</p><p>A head – Jin Ling’s – pokes through the doorway.</p><p>“Uncle,” he says. There is a pleading tone to his voice that Jiang Cheng decides then and there that he needs to train out of him. “I’ve unpacked already. Can I go, please?”</p><p><em>To find Lan Sizhui</em>, the question finishes, unspoken. It’s only been a few days since Jiang Cheng gave his nephew the talk that had him blushing and stuttering like a twelve-year-old girl. If Jin Ling is willing to bring his boyfriend up again so soon, it must mean the boy is invested in the relationship.</p><p>Jiang Cheng nods sharply, and Jin Ling’s face lights up.</p><p>“But you have to be back before two-thirty,” he barks, before the kid can run off. The first meeting starts at three, and he wants to give them some leeway to get ready. Much as he hates to admit it, his nephew takes nearly as long to primp as a society lady. Jin Ling must get it from his father’s side – after all, Jiang Cheng’s Ah-Jie never cared too much about what she looked like beyond how it reflected on their family.</p><p>Jin Ling agrees happily, and dashes off to go find Lan Sizhui. In this moment, he looks so excited, so much like Jiang Yanli did on her first real date with Jin Zixuan. It hurts for a second, but then the boy is gone from the room, the gold of his robes flapping behind him. If Lan Wangji and Weiwuxian’s adopted son breaks Jin Ling’s heart, there will be absolute hell to pay.</p><p>The older man sighs. Of all the people in the world, why did his nephew have to pick <em>that one</em>? Even Lan Jingyi would be less problematic.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>With nothing else to do, Jiang Cheng spends the next two hours wandering around the Cloud Recesses, re-familiarising himself with the place. Little has changed since he was a student here, despite the fact that the sect had been burned down as part of the Wens’ reign of terror. Exactly as Lotus Pier was.</p><p>A series of images flashes behind his eyes.</p><p>
    <em>…flames licking at wood and the charred corpses of his friends, reaching towards the night sky… purple robes spattered with blood… a firework blooming in the sky in the shape of a sun…</em>
    </p><p>
    <em>…the scent of burning flesh…</em>
    </p><p>
    <em>His mother screaming.</em>
    </p><p>He shakes the memories away. Tells himself to move past it. It’s been over fifteen years, and he’s not a seventeen-year-old weakling anymore. When the rage threatens to overwhelm him, he forces it down with an effort.</p><p><em>Don’t fucking do this. Not now. Not here</em>.</p><p>The Wens… the Wens are all gone. He’s killed every last one of them. They’re dead. They’re gone. He keeps walking.</p><p>Without realising it, Jiang Cheng’s feet take him to the courtyard, where the disciples are practicing their swordwork. There are kids from all the different sects, their robes reflecting their origins. Gold for the Lanling Jin sect, black for Qinghe Nie, purple for his own Yunmeng Jiang disciples, and others from smaller houses in orange, blue, green, and so on. He watches them carefully, noting their technique, though he can’t help but compare them with Jin Ling.</p><p>The results are pleasing. Jiang Cheng’s nephew is good, much better than most of the disciples here, but the rest aren’t too far behind. As a whole, their movements are clean and precise; while lacking in fluidity, that will come with experience.</p><p>He stays at the edges of the courtyard, careful not to be noticed. It would be a terrible idea to disrupt a class on his first day here.</p><p>Hanguang-Jun walks between the rows of disciples moving through their sword forms, correcting a thrust here, a parry there, a disciple’s grip in a tricky motion. Handsome and expressionless as ever, he hardly ever talks, simply directing the class through well-timed <em>looks</em>. His features are a perfect mirror of his brother’s, but where Zewu-Jun is gentle and approachable, Lan Wangji is a stone-cold bastard.</p><p>As if feeling Jiang Cheng’s eyes on him, the older man looks up and <em>straight at him</em>, sending him what looks to be the ‘death glare of doom’. Jiang Cheng’s hackles rise.</p><p>He’s been in a bad mood all day, and <em>what is this guy’s fucking problem anyway</em>? Jiang Cheng is here at the request of Lan Qiren, the man’s own goddamn uncle. And here Lan Wangji is, giving him this look that says <em>I want you gone</em>. Jiang Cheng doesn’t even actually <em>want</em> to be here! Hell, he’d leave right now if he could.</p><p>The only reason he’s even at Cloud Recesses in the first place is because he’s sick of being the only person who gives a shit about his sect. He’s fucking tired of having to fight all the others at the yearly gatherings who think they can take Yunmeng’s place in the four great clans if they can cow the young Jiang sect leader who has no family to back him up.</p><p>And most of all, he wants better for Jin Ling when the boy finally takes the reins of the Lanling Jin sect. The others will eat him <em>alive</em> if things continue the way they are now.</p><p>Jiang Cheng wants to storm up there and punch Lan Wangji in his blank fucking face. Hands clench into fists at his sides, and he thinks he might actually do it, staring disciples be damned. But his father’s voice echoes in his ear.</p><p><em>Control your temper, boy</em>, the ghost of Jiang Fengmian says. While alive, the man was renowned for being calm and collected enough that he wouldn’t have been out of place among those who wore the white robes of Gusu. <em>There is a time and place for anger, but it is rarely when you would most like to release it</em>.</p><p>The first time his father said this to him, Jiang Cheng had been twelve and worked-up over something he can no longer remember. Then the Jiang sect leader slid his gaze over to his scowling wife and uttered those words, and all the fight went out of the young disciple. Jiang Cheng felt very small then, and very sad, and couldn’t quite explain why, even to himself.</p><p>That had been the tantrum of a boy. Now, the man clenches his fists tighter, until his short nails dig into his palms hard enough to leave marks. He chooses the most venomous from his impressive repertoire of glares and shoots it at Hanguang-Jun, then turns around and stalks off, fuming.</p><p>Soft footsteps echo in the corridors as Jiang Cheng takes a right, then a left, and another right. He is heading for the tiny garden that was his refuge as a student. Perhaps by the small fountain, he might not be quite so angry. It is always peaceful there.</p><p>But just as he turns another corner, he collides with a lithe, muscled chest. Black and red fill his vision, and he looks down into the face of someone who is both a stranger, and the person who has known him the longest in this world. Wei Wuxian.</p>

    <p>The other man lets out a surprised ‘oof!’ and grabs Jiang Cheng’s forearms to steady himself. Jiang Cheng’s first instinct is to recoil from the touch, but he lets Wei Wuxian use him to regain his bearings.</p><p>He’s always had little in the way of physical contact. His parents had never hugged him much – the only times Jiang Cheng’s mother ever held him was in his fuzzy memories of early childhood, and that last, desperate embrace by the water’s edge. He remembers seeing his father engulf another child in a hug when he was ten years old, and realising he could count on one hand the times he’d received the same.. Jiang Yanli, for all her sweetness and steady affection, rarely held him either.</p><p>Over time, Jiang Cheng learned to convince himself that he disliked the touch of other people. If only because he received it so little that it was better to believe he’d never wanted it in the first place.</p><p>His older brother had been the exception to that rule. Oh, it wasn’t that Jiang Cheng was special – Wei Wuxian was just an extremely tactile person. He could hardly go five minutes without slinging an arm over another’s shoulders, or a slap on the back during a particularly heated conversation.</p><p>But that was okay, because Wei Wuxian was bright like the sun, and it felt so good to have some of that warmth directed at him.</p><p>Now, that same boy in Mo Xuanyu’s body grins up at him and gives a startled laugh. It feels a little strange to see that familiar smile shining out of a stranger’s face.</p><p>“Hey, Jiang Cheng! I didn’t see you there!” Wei Wuxian laughs, and something in Jiang Cheng’s chest tightens at the sound. His long hair is up in a ponytail, tied back with a red ribbon. It falls to curl around the lobe of his ear. “You here for the sect leader gathering?”</p><p>The sect leader in question nods. “I received an invitation from Lan Qiren two days ago asking me to come. Jin Ling is here as well.”</p><p>“That’s great! Sizhui has been really excited to see him – Jingyi too, but that’s different, you know?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng snickers.</p><p>“Jin Ling lasted about five seconds before he ran off to go find a certain someone,” he admits, loosening up a little at the easy, familiar banter. “After we returned to Lotus Pier the other day, I <em>talked</em> to him about it.”</p><p>The meaning of the words takes a few minutes to register. Then, a choking sound escapes from Wei Wuxian and he doubles over, his face bright red with poorly-repressed laughter.</p><p>“Oh…” he says, in between gasps and cackles of mirth. “Oh, that’s priceless. I’ll bet the Young Mistress was <em>so </em>embarrassed.”</p><p>The automatic response, of course, is a curt ‘don’t call him that’, but it’s said without any real heat. Wei Wuxian takes another few minutes to collect himself, then asks the question he always asks whenever they see each other.</p><p>“How are you doing, by the way?”</p><p>The question is casual, but Jiang Cheng freezes up immediately. Just like that, the moment is gone and there they are again, no longer brothers but two strangers trying to navigate a conversation and failing miserably.</p><p>This was a mistake, and Wei Wuxian knows it.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“I’m really excited for the gatherings this week,” he says, recognising Jiang Cheng’s closed-off response for what it is and desperately trying to salvage the situation. “Lan Zhan said I could sit in as his husband and all, even though I’m not a sect leader. I think this could be really good for all of us, you know – not just some sects, but for everybody. We’ll all have backup if something goes wrong, and we won’t have to face problems on our own anymore!</p><p>His eyes are lit up now, and Jiang Cheng watches the passion on his animated face.</p><p>“Lan Zhan was really into it when I suggested it to him. He thought it was a great idea.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s brain short-circuits.</p><p>“Wait. You’re saying <em>you </em>came up with this?”</p><p>The ex-Yiling Patriarch flinches at his incredulous tone like it’s a physical blow. Hurt flashes briefly in his eyes. Then he recovers, plasters on another blinding grin, though his tone remains more subdued.</p><p>“Yeah,” he replies. “I thought all the sects needed to come together, for unity and stuff. I told Lan Zhan about it, then he passed the idea on to Lan Qiren. I never actually thought the old man would go through with it – he never listens to me about anything! – but well…”</p><p>His shoulders go up in a shrug, arms spread in a universal gesture that means ‘shit happens, I guess’.</p><p>Of fucking <em>course</em> this was Wei Wuxian’s idea. Who else would be so damn selfless to think of something that would help so many people, and actually figure out a way to carry it out?</p><p>Sure, all he’s done is say a few things to the right people, but he’s actually gotten Sect Leader Lan’s notoriously prickly uncle to agree to something, and that’s a miracle in and of itself. And now Jiang Cheng’s here, again, dragged into this whole thing because of another one of Wei Wuxian’s schemes. Just like when they were kids.</p><p>There’s an ugly thing churning in his gut that feels a litle bitter and a lot like jealousy. He tries his hardest to squash it down and shove a heavy weight over it so it’ll flatten and he can pretend it’s not there, and he tries not to be disappointed when that fails.</p><p>(He’s thirty-four and a fucking sect leader and he’s <em>still</em> envious of his older brother. Pathetic.)</p><p>But it’s not Wei Wuxian’s fault. He doesn’t deserve Jiang Cheng’s hatred; not for this. This is Jiang Cheng’s problem, and he’ll deal with it himself.</p><p>“Well, congratulations, I guess,” he offers. The other man visibly brightens at the praise. “Personally, I hope it goes well. For all our sakes.”</p><p>The conversation lasts a little while longer before beginning to fizzle out.</p><p>Checking the time, Jiang Cheng mutters a curse.</p><p>“It’s almost two-thirty,” he says, by way of explanation. “I told Jin Ling he’d better be back before then. I’ll break that little shit’s legs if he’s late!”</p><p>A laugh from his side tells Jiang Cheng exactly what Jin Ling’s other uncle thinks of that remark.</p><p>“A while ago, the kid told me that you never actually follow through on that threat. I know you only do that for Jin Ling’s own good. Don’t worry – your secret’s safe with me.” Wei Wuxian winks dramatically. “I won’t tell anyone you’re really a big softie under there.”</p><p>Before he can think about what he’s doing, Jiang Cheng elbows the other man like he used to when they were young and his brother said something particularly stupid. Wei Wuxian yelps in surprise, then elbows him back.</p><p>Jiang Cheng gives his iciest glare.</p><p>“I assure you, you have completely misjudged both my character and intentions.”</p><p>“Yeah, right.”</p><p>Out of the blue, Wei Wuxian lunges forward and wraps his arms around the taller man. There is a sudden rush of warmth that Jiang Cheng feels even through his thick robes, and he tenses up suddenly.</p><p>“Take care of yourself, little brother,” says the man who was once Yunmeng’s brightest disciple. His tone is gentle, and uncharacteristically serious.</p><p>With an effort, Jiang Cheng relaxes his muscles. Allows his own arms to come up to fit awkwardly over Wei Wuxian’s back.</p><p>“You too,” he whispers back, and it surprises him how much he means it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>As promised, Jin Ling comes back at exactly two-thirty. He is out of breath from sprinting through Cloud Recesses from wherever the hell he and Lan Sizhui have been for the past couple of hours, but he looks happy, content.</p><p>Even though Jiang Cheng is pretty sure he’s going to receive a complaint from Lan Qiren about his nephew breaking about a dozen sect rules with his behaviour, he keeps his mouth shut, and keeps the snark to a single eyebrow raise that garners a flush in response. Jin Ling gets defensive easily, and <em>he’s</em> certainly not going to be the one to rain on the boy’s parade. Anyway, with the meeting that’s going to take place in just half an hour, he’s probably going to need every scrap of positive feeling he can get.</p><p>They spend the next twenty minutes getting ready in silence, then when both of them are prepared, they make their way to the appointed meeting-place.</p><p>The location where the gatherings will take place over the next week is a large walled pavilion far away from the student quarters and class buildings. It is a place Jiang Cheng has visited a few times before during the Gusu Lan sect’s turn at hosting the annual sect leaders’ convention.</p><p>Jin Ling, however, has never seen this part of Cloud Recesses before, and looks around with curiosity, drinking in every tiny detail.</p><p>Places have been set up around the pavilion in a rectangular formation, each with their own small table holding a pot of tea and an empty bowl. In any other sect, the pot would contain wine. However, this is the home of the Lans, where any form of alcohol is prohibited.</p><p>Jiang Cheng smirks inwardly at the disappointment on some of the other clan heads’ faces. Ironically enough, Gusu is famous for its quality booze, the ever-popular Emperor’s Smile – Wei Wuxian’s favourite drink. Doubtless the others had been hoping to get a taste for free, as compensation for having to come all this way.</p><p>He ought to get a jar or two for the staff back home. Maybe that would ease their disappointment a little when he finally returned.</p><p>To Jiang Cheng’s surprise, all twenty sect leaders are present, excluding Lan Xichen. He spots Nie Huaisang on the right, hiding his face behind an elaborately-painted fan.</p><p>Lan Wangji is here as well (of course), looking as though carved from jade as he kneels, motionless, behind his table. He doesn’t even spare a glance for Jiang Cheng as the two of them enter and take their seats side by side.</p><p>Jin Ling, however, receives a courteous nod. Owing mostly to his… friendly relationship with the other man’s son, Jiang Cheng would bet.</p><p>This behaviour is deeply petty, and it’s amusing in its own small way. Who would’ve thought even the illustrious Hanguang-Jun was subject to the whims of his emotions like the rest of the mere mortals?</p><p>The other sect leaders file in, some looking road-weary, others as though they’ve been taking advantage of the Gusu Lan sect’s hospitality for a few days. Lan Qiren himself enters from a side door.</p><p>When everyone is seated, the acting Lan head opens the meeting.</p><p>“I thank you all for your willingness to come here, especially those who arrived on short notice.”</p><p>He inclines his head in a respectful gesture, and everyone else returns it. At Jiang Cheng’s prompting glare, Jin Ling bows instead, as befits his much younger age. It matters little that he is already a sect leader in name and will fill the role as well in due time – seniority is everything in the world they live in.</p><p>The Lanling Jin sect elder seated on Jin Ling’s other side looks on with approval. No one seems to have been offended yet.</p><p>
    <em>That’s good. Baby steps.</em>
    </p><p>Lan Qiren continues. “By now, you all know why our sect has called this meeting. We aim to promote inter-sect unity and in doing so, increase prosperity for all involved. It is our hope that you will join us.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng and Nie Huaisang share a look. This is awkward as fuck. Both of them – and a few of the others here – have been under Lan Qiren’s tutelage before. They still remember his droning during lessons, and the way his face went purple with rage when a student (mainly Wei Wuxian) had talked back to them. He’d had them doing lines numerous times, too, and now he’s <em>politely requesting </em>things from them? This is surreal.</p><p>The older man finishes his speech and sits down, stroking his beard absently. The room is quiet for a second, then the noise level abruptly rises as a great deal of people try to talk at once.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it is Nie Huaisang who resolves the issue. He snaps his fan closed and brings it down hard on the table. The resulting ‘smack’ shocks everyone into silence, and he waves a hand at an orange-robed man who looks to be over two hundred. He takes it as his cue to resume talking.</p><p>“How do we know that what you say is true, Master Lan? Small houses such as mine have suffered before, but few others, including the Four Great Sects, show themselves to be willing to aid us.”</p><p>The old man laces his bony fingers together as he speaks, and many of the others around the room find themselves agreeing. Another – a stocky middle-aged man in blue – speaks up as well.</p><p>“Too many times, we have formed so-called alliances with other sects, only to be ignored when trouble arises. This ‘unity’, as you refer to it, seems to stand only in times of prosperity, but fails when it is truly needed.”</p><p>This time, it is a white-haired man wearing green robes who opens his mouth.</p><p>“Marriage alliances have not worked for centuries. How are we to ensure our sects’ interests are looked after if we must perpetually take care of the needs of others?”</p><p>One of the only female cultivators at the table – a youngish woman barely over a hundred – looks up and crosses her arms over her chest.</p><p>“Equality is another issue if this is to go forward. What measures shall be put in place to ensure all our clans will receive the same protections and benefits? I will not have my sect looked down upon because a woman happens to be leading it!”</p><p>The discussion grows more heated as nearly everyone in the room has a go at why the idea of a cultivators’ union is a pipe dream. Irritation scrapes its claws over Jiang Cheng’s skin.</p><p>This, <em>this</em> is exactly the reason he thought this gathering would not work. They all have valid points, but the other sect leaders are too busy complaining about the situation to try to think of a solution. From the looks of it, Jin Ling is thinking much the same thing as he twiddles his thumbs in his lap. His brows furrow towards the vermilion mark on his forehead as he listens to the conversation.</p><p>Jiang Cheng scowls and pours himself a bowl of tea. He drinks deeply, emptying it, then slams the bowl down on the table, much as Nie Huaisang did with his fan.</p><p>The room quiets again.</p><p>“If I may,” he says coldly, sweeping everyone in the room with the frosty glare that made him famous as <em>that guy you do not mess with</em>. “Perhaps we might direct our efforts to thinking of a solution instead.”</p>

    <p>The meeting goes a bit better after that. The sect leaders quit shrieking and actually sit down and discuss the issue like civilised people. No solutions have yet been put forward, of course – that’s a little too much to hope for, even for the supposed leaders of all the sects in the cultivation world.</p><p>However, by the time the meeting is over, they do actually reach some sort of consensus on the ground rules for this twenty-way partnership that Lan Qiren has proposed. The ideal arrangement is a sort of board or council, on which every sect would have a seat, equal say, and be subject to the same rules as all the other clans. Each sect would be held in check by the other nineteen, which would help prevent events like those leading up to the Sunshot Campaign.</p><p>It’s a nice idea, and Jiang Cheng is actually pleasantly surprised by the progress they’ve made thus far. A fucking miracle, is what it is, that they have – wonder of wonders – managed to get all the sect leaders to agree to a set of standards. Actually upholding them, though, is going to be the tricky bit.</p><p>There’s a saying that his mother used to recite to him when he was a child. “Give someone an inch, and they’ll want a foot. Give them that, and they’ll ask for a mile.”</p><p>Tackling the sect leaders is the same way – each and every one of them will try and see just what they can get away with. Once they find that out, they’ll keep on pushing until they can do whatever they damn well please without facing the consequences.</p><p>That was true for Jin Guangyao, and it was true for Wen Ruohan; Jiang Cheng is pretty sure by this point that it applies to most of humanity. His Ah-Niang had certainly thought so.</p><p>They’ll have to figure out a way to enforce the rules they set so that everyone is held accountable for their actions. Otherwise, those rules will become meaningless and everything will go right back to normal. And what everyone has more or less agreed on is that they don’t like the way things are.</p><p>Finally, they adjourn the meeting. Lan Qiren sounds the gong that signals the end of it, and everyone stands up to leave. They’ve barely scratched the surface, but Jiang Cheng guesses that’s what the rest of the week is for.</p><p>It still seems too optimistic, though. He thinks they’ll probably need another fortnight at least to get anything done, much less finalise any agreements.</p><p>They’ve been in the pavilion for hours by the time Jiang Cheng and Jin Ling finally go outside. The sun has set almost all the way; only a sliver of gold remains above the horizon. Everything is cast in shadow, and the lights of Caiyi Village at the foot of the mountain are already lit.</p><p>Some of the sect leaders mill around outside the doorways, chatting amongst themselves. Those that actually enjoy each other’s company, that is. Two of the younger cultivators are attempting to flirt with the woman who spoke up during the first, disorganised part of the meeting. They are not, however, meeting with much success.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s been on enough failed dates to recognise a disaster when he sees one, and sends up a ‘thank you’ to the heavens that he doesn’t do <em>that</em> anymore. Jin Ling turns to look at whatever it is he’s watching, smirking when he follows his uncle’s gaze to the unfortunate pair.</p><p>The older man narrows his eyes at his nephew, who remains oblivious. He’s going to have to teach the brat not to laugh at people with relationship troubles. It’s self-preservation, really, now that the kid’s got a boyfriend and he’s still single as fuck.</p><p>The two of them head back to their quarters, and get stopped on the way by Lan Jingyi. He lights up when he sees them, grinning and dashing over to make a hasty bow.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang! And the Young Mistress!” The young disciple looks rather like a puppy wagging its tail, all wide eyes and excited smiles. Jin Ling huffs a little at the nickname, but there’s no real anger in it. At this point, it’s more a term of affection than anything else.</p><p>“Senior Wei’s been looking for you,” he says. “Oh, and thank you Sect Leader Jiang! Lan Qiren didn’t catch me after all – well, he did in the end, but it took him two whole days, so I only had to copy the sect rules fifteen times instead of fifty!”</p><p>He exclaims the last bit cheerfully, with the air of someone so used to getting into trouble that any respite from it is greeted with relief.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” says Jiang Cheng gruffly, although he’s not quite sure that writing out over four thousand Lan sect rules fifteen times is any sort of bonus at all. And knowing the lunatics he calls a clan, Lan Jingyi will probably have to complete all that while holding a handstand position. Crazy fuckers.</p><p>Though it does explain where that prodigious arm strength comes from. He’s heard (eternally scarring) stories from Wei Wuxian about what Lan Wangji does with his arms in private that he never wants to hear again. He remembers how he’d noticed Lan Xichen’s broad shoulders when they were seated side-by-side in the latter’s garden.</p><p>It seems to be a result of nurture rather than nature, since everyone knows the rumours that Lan Sizhui isn’t actually a Lan by birth and he can benchpress with the best of them.</p><p>Lan Jingyi gives another jerky bow before attempting a semi-graceful exit down the corridor. The kid’s coordinated enough, Jiang Cheng thinks, but he tries too hard to mimic the easy elegance of the rest of his sect. He’s built for running places, not walking sedately towards them.</p><p>When he’s gone, Jin Ling glowers.</p><p>“Do we <em>have</em> to go?”, he asks rather sullenly. Jiang Cheng hears the silent plea in his voice.</p><p>Jin Ling still isn’t quite comfortable with his other uncle. Wei Wuxian is too free with his touches, too easy with his affection, and the boy isn’t used to receiving attention like that. It’s probably Jiang Cheng’s fault, like so many other things. His nephew is too much like him; always has been.</p><p>But Jiang Cheng nods, gives a stern ‘yes’, and keeps from frowning when Jin Ling sighs in disappointment. Regardless of his own feelings on the matter, Jiang Yanli would have wanted her son to be close to both his uncles, not just the one who raised him.</p><p>He tries not to feel bitter about that.</p><p>The two of them make their way to the training grounds. Even though Lan Jingyi didn’t give them an exact description of Wei Wuxian’s whereabouts, he can usually be found there, giving tips on fighting techniques to young disciples overawed by the infamous Yiling Patriarch.</p><p>Practice is finishing up for the day when they get there. The sun has finally set all the way, and even with the lanterns, there isn’t enough light to see properly for training to continue. The disciples are packing up, storing the practice dummies in neat rows in a tiny shed. Noise is kept to a minimum, of course.</p><p>They find Wei Wuxian sitting in the fork of a tree, watching the proceedings below. He’s got a blade of long grass in his mouth and is attempting to whistle around it. When he sees them, he jumps off the branch, landing gracefully on his feet.</p><p>“How’d it go?”, he asks, grinning broadly. There’s a hint of nervousness in his smile. Of course there is – the gatherings were his idea. “Lan Zhan’s got some stuff to do, so he’s not here right now. He’s talking to Old Man Lan about tomorrow’s meeting.”</p><p>“Surprisingly well, actually. We actually had a real discussion like adults instead of screeching at each other.”</p><p>Jin Ling jumps in. “It was pretty cool. There was a lot of shouting in the first few minutes, but then Uncle glared at them and sort of told them to shut up and be productive, and after that, it got better.”</p><p>That gets a chuckle from Wei Wuxian, who reaches out to ruffle Jin Ling’s hair. Unexpectedly, the boy lets him do it.</p><p>Huh. Maybe there is hope for a relationship after all.</p><p>“Nie Huaisang is a lot more involved than he used to be,” says Jiang Cheng. “I think he’s realised the jig is up and he can’t go on pretending to be useless anymore.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s an idea! I’ll talk to him later. Maybe he can lend me some dirty magazines, just for old times’ sake.” Wei Wuxian leers, and Jin Ling flushes red. “There’s some stuff Lan Zhan and I have been wanting to try.”</p><p>At least some things haven’t changed. Jiang Cheng’s thick-skinned brother is still as shameless as ever. <em>Oh gods, please fucking stop</em>. He cringes internally. Poor choice of words.</p><p>There are some things you never want to picture any of your relatives doing, especially if it’s with someone with whom you share a mutual hatred.</p><p>…And it gets worse.</p><p>“Or <em>you</em> might want them, Jin Ling. You know, Sizhui didn’t turn out all stuffy like Old Man Lan. He has <em>me </em>for a parent, after all. And Lan Zhan is actually pretty adventurous.”</p><p>“Wei Wuxian!”, he barks before Jin Ling spontaneously combusts of embarrassment. His nephew is making a noise like he’s dying and Jiang Cheng is seriously concerned that might happen. He didn’t suffer through sixteen years of tears and sleepless nights raising this kid just so Jin Ling’s other uncle could kill him. “That’s enough.”</p><p>The shorter man pouts. “Buzzkill,” he sniffs.</p><p>“Anyway, I was looking for you ‘cause Lan Zhan wants to let his big brother know how the meeting went, but he’s busy and won’t be able to talk to him before nine. He told me you ran into him the other day and didn’t kill each other, so you know the way.”</p><p>“Why can’t you do it?”</p><p>It’s barely perceptible, Wei Wuxian’s shoulders slump a little.</p><p>“I don’t think he likes me all that much,” he says. “Talking to me always makes him sad. I think I remind him of things he’d rather not think about.”</p><p>This has obviously been beating him up for a while. For some reason, Wei Wuxian’s brother-in-law doesn’t want to talk to him, and it’s hurting him, because he badly wants to be accepted by Lan Zhan’s family, since he has so little left of his own.</p><p>Other people might not notice, but Jiang Cheng grew up with him. He may have spent thirteen years hating Wei Wuxian, but he’d spent a decade before that as his older brother’s defender, distracting Ah-Niang when she got angry, cleaning up the aftermath of Wei Wuxian’s more outrageous pranks. Even chasing dogs away when they sent him into a panic. The instinct is still there, after all this time.</p><p>“Alright,” Jiang Cheng says finally. The other man brightens immediately, and thanks him. Jin Ling has left by this point, probably gone back to his quarters to sulk and berate the heavens for giving him relatives like this.</p><p>“Oh! I nearly forgot!” Wei Wuxian rummages in the folds of his robes and brings out a plain white ceramic jar with an equally plain blue lid. He passes it to Jiang Cheng, who hefts it experimentally. The jar is heavy for its size, and sloshes like there’s liquid in it. “Lan Zhan also asked me to get you to pass on Zewu-Jun’s favourite tea.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng hums a reply. It’s just a small favour; not too big a deal. They say goodbye to each other for the night, and go their separate ways, Wei Wuxian probably heading back to Lan Wangji’s <em>jingshi</em>, and Jiang Cheng to Lan Xichen’s quiet little cottage. The two of them will undoubtedly meet many times in the next week. Jiang Cheng finds that’s not as daunting a thought as it once was.</p><p>It’s fully dark now, but Jiang Cheng has no difficulty picking out the path that will lead him to where he wants to go. There are lanterns scattered everywhere, burning a soft yellow, and the moon overhead casts everything in a silver glow. Cloud Recesses perches at the peak of a mountain, so the stars look closer than they do back home, bigger and brighter somehow.</p><p>He makes his way through the twists and turns of the corridors. Jiang Cheng has always had a good sense of direction; it serves him well on night hunts, and in times like these.</p><p>It’s a little past eight o’ clock when he finally reaches the end of the maze. The luminous white walls open up onto the cottage and its little garden. There are only a few lanterns along the edge of the path – the space is small and fire is dangerous to have around plants.</p><p>The house is lit from inside, though, a cheery yellow glow spilling out through the windows, onto the rows of flower bushes. Since the garden is empty, Jiang Cheng supposes that Zewu-Jun must be in the cottage instead.</p><p>For some reason, his heart beats a little faster in his chest at the thought. He’s never been inside Lan Xichen’s rooms before, and for good reason. Isn’t there some sort of rule against that here?</p><p>Annoyed, he takes a deep breath and tries to squash his racing pulse. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to work that way. His body is harder to shut up than his emotions.</p><p>He clenches his hand into a fist and knocks on the door.</p><p>“Who’s there?”, a voice calls out. Jiang Cheng remains stubbornly silent until a few moments later, when Lan Xichen opens up.</p><p>A look of surprise flashes across his face for a split second, before the First Jade of Gusu’s trademark gentle smile superimposes itself on his handsome features.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang,” he says smoothly, welcoming. “What an unexpected pleasure. Come in.”</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>When Lan Huan hears a knock on his door, his first thought is that his brother is here. His heart gives a little leap at the thought. Wangji told him that he would come by every day this week to give a short report on how the meetings had gone, and any headway they were making in clan unity.</p><p>His little brother had been so excited. From the time the two of them were small, the only thing Wangji wanted was the betterment of their sect, and everything he did worked towards that goal. The only thing that deviated from it was, well, his relationship with the ex-Yiling Patriarch and demonic cultivator. Lan Huan still isn’t entirely sure how he feels about that.</p><p>“Who’s there?”, he calls, more out of habit than anything else. It’s unexpected when only silence answers instead of his brother’s low voice, pitched in a familiar “hmm”.</p><p>Perhaps the visitor is someone else? Lan Huan banishes the thought before it can take root.</p><p>Few others care enough to visit him, isolated as he is. Lan Qiren is one of them, but he rarely comes, and never at night, especially so close to the end of the day. Maybe Wei Wuxian would, if Lan Huan hadn’t driven his brother-in-law away months ago by making the other man’s first visits as uncomfortable as their sect’s strict rules on politeness allowed.</p><p>He ignores the faint twinge of regret he feels at that.</p><p>Putting the last of the dishes from dinner on the rack to dry, Lan Huan moves out of the small kitchen and over to the door. It clicks when he unlocks it, then gives a soft wheeze as it swings open.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin is standing outside his house, a white ceramic jar dangling from the long fingers of one hand, the famed sword Sandu strapped to his slender waist. There is a fierce scowl on his face as he looks Lan Huan up and down, and the First Jade of the Lan sect is suddenly very aware of how he must look.</p><p>His once-spotleess white sleeves are rolled up to the elbows, creased and flecked with water and dish soap. His hair hangs down his back in the loose braid he wears to sleep, and his forehead ribbon is ever so slightly crooked.</p><p>Lan Huan is a mess, and he knows it.</p><p>The other man, by comparison, is dressed impeccably, the crisp folds in his formal violet robes as severe as the expression he wears, which is quite a feat.</p><p>Lan Huan tries not to let the surprise show on his face. He is, however, only partially successful, judging by the way Jiang Wanyin cocks his eyebrow before Lan Huan manages to get his expression under control.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang, what an unexpected pleasure,” he says, struggling to infuse his voice with his usual good humour. <em>Emphasis on ‘unexpected’</em>. Where is Wangji? What could have possessed Sandu-Shengshou to visit him at this hour, out here in the middle of nowhere?</p><p>Still, Lan Huan is a sect leader – of the Gusu Lan sect at that – and he remembers his manners. Any visitor, no matter how sudden, cannot be turned away at the door.</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin dips his head in acknowledgement and follows Lan Huan into the living room. The younger man looks ill at ease here, in the living quarters of a near stranger, but he takes Lan Huan’s lead and seats himself on a straw mat.</p><p>“I apologise for the disruption,” he says, dark eyes flashing. “I understand that this is a late hour by the standards of your sect, and so I will not keep you longer than necessary.”</p><p>In Jiang Wanyin’s expression, Lan Huan can see that the other sect leader is rather uncomfortable with the situation. As he well should be. There are very few things that would justify barging into the rooms of a cultivator in seclusion, especially in the Cloud Recesses, where manners are everything.</p><p>The previous occasion was an accident, of course, but such circumstances should not have been repeated. And anyway, there is nary a rabbit in sight.</p><p>“It is my understanding that your brother has agreed to report to you on the progress of the sect leaders’ gatherings. However, Hanguang-Jun is otherwise engaged at the moment, and your brother-in-law has requested that I be the one to give the account of the day’s events in his stead.”</p><p>Interesting. Lan Huan internally berates himself for not considering earlier that Wangji would be too busy to spend time with him. Lately, his brother has been run off his feet with all the planning and preparation for this event, and though Lan Huan has tried to help with some of the paperwork, there is little he can do from inside these walls.</p><p>It was inconsiderate of him to expect Wangji to make himself available to update him, on top of all his extra duties and responsibilities. Though Wei Wuxian was thoughtful, Lan Huan supposes, to make sure he was caught up anyway.</p><p>“Thank you,” he replies.</p><p>The other man didn’t have to come all this way just to visit him, even to fulfill Wei Wuxian’s request. Jiang Wanyin’s relationship with the reincarnated necromancer is famously even rockier than Lan Huan’s own. And he looks tired.</p><p>Lan Huan understands. After all, he’s sat through the exact same gatherings year after year, listening to the others bicker about stolen land and petty challenges between cultivators trying to one-up each other. He knows how tiring these meetings can be.</p><p>The two of them have been leaders of their own sects for about the same amount of time, despite the difference in their ages. Lotus Pier burned down only a few months after Cloud Recesses had, and both of them were thrust at an early age into a responsibility neither was ready for.</p><p>Lan Huan had been twenty-one at the time, barely able to call himself a man and have the elders nod instead of smile patronizingly. Jiang Wanyin had been only seventeen, too young to do the same.</p><p>As he listens to the other man describe the day’s events – which seem to have turned out remarkably well thus far, as no serious arguments have yet broken out – Lan Huan wonders why they never became close. They had faced similar situations: their parents murdered in the Wens’ reign of terror, homes razed to the ground; yet Lan Huan cannot recall any point in the last fifteen years where they had discussed anything more meaningful than the agenda for the day’s meeting.</p><p>Perhaps it had been that infamous temper, or the bitter scowl that looked far too at home on the face of someone so young. Lan Huan remembers the stories that were told in whispers cut off when Sect Leader Jiang entered the room, of how he’d laughed as he slaughtered entire armies with his adopted brother by his side, and later, dragged men and women into his sect as fodder for his whip. The bodies, it was said, were never found.</p><p>But then, what right does Lan Huan have to judge another’s grief? He, who locked himself away and hid from the world when things got too hard, when too much was taken from him. It is not his place to sit on a high horse and pass judgement, because he left his family to deal with the mess he’d left behind, and Jiang Wanyin has not betrayed <em>his</em>.</p><p>He pulls himself out of his thoughts when he notices the other sect leader gazing expectantly at him, as though waiting for his opinion. Lan Huan was not so lost in his own head that he could not follow the report, and so he gives it.</p><p>“The discussion seems to be progressing rather well,” he says, smiling. Wangji ought to be pleased. “I look forward to hearing more about the gatherings as the week goes on.”</p><p>The other man nods gruffly. Over the past few minutes, his scowl has lightened a few shades, but his expression is still far from friendly.</p><p>“The meeting was much more productive than I had expected,” he admits. “But it could have gone better if the others hadn’t spent so much time moaning about how often things went wrong in the past. I swear, if I hear one more old man complain about his failed marriage alliance…”</p><p>He trails off, the furrows between his brows deepening. Lan Huan can’t help it; he laughs. He knows it might be construed as ill-mannered to laugh at another sect leader, but he can picture the aged Sect Leader Liu, with his perpetual squint, waxing endlessly in his croaky voice about his marriage to an esteemed female cultivator that had produced only daughters, with nary a male heir in sight.</p><p>But amazingly, Jiang Wanyin is not angered. Instead, his thunderous expression lightens, like storm clouds clearing away to reveal sun and blue sky. He is rather handsome when he is not scowling – or rather, when he is scowling less severely.</p><p>Abruptly, Lan Huan thinks of the supposedly-unspoken rule that is passed around in the sects outside Lotus Pier. <em>Whoever you mess with, do not mess with the Yunmeng Jiang sect; whoever you piss off, do not piss off Jiang Wanyin</em>.</p><p>The language is rather crude, but it gets the point across. Lan Huan wonders if any of the people who utter it have seen Sect Leader Jiang like this, awkward and open and surprisingly young.</p><p>The man in question holds out his hand – the one with the jar in it. With the other, he rubs the back of his neck, which has gone rather red.</p><p>“Wei Wuxian asked me to pass this on to you. He said Hanguang-Jun would like me to ensure that you receive the tea he usually gives you.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Lan Huan says, taking the jar.</p><p>His chest goes a little warm. Of course Wangji would remember. This tea is his favourite, made from the leaves of a flower only grown in Caiyi Village. He can’t purchase it himself anymore, but his brother makes sure to bring a box or two along with him when he visits.</p><p>It is unusual, though, for him to send it in a jar. Normally, he gives Lan Huan a supply of tea bags so he can make it himself when the mood strikes, but the container is heavy with liquid.</p><p>He meets Sect Leader Jiang’s eyes, gray like the surface of a lake before a storm.</p><p>“Would you like some?”</p><p>The other man hesitates, and for a moment, Lan Huan thinks he’s going to refuse. After all, Sandu-Shengshou has many enemies; he is, understandably, a very paranoid man.</p><p>But then he nods and gives a faint “yes, please”, and that is that.</p><p>Setting the jar down on the floor, Lan Huan rises and walks into the kitchen. He comes back out with two large mugs, plain blue-and-white without handles. Jiang Wanyin watches silently as Lan Huan kneels on the mat once more and pours the tea, then holds out one mug, which he takes.</p><p>He sits, the container clasped between his hands, resting on his thighs, while the Lan sect leader takes a deep drink from his own mug. Lan Huan frowns.</p><p>“This tastes different from the tea Wangji normally sends,” he says. It’s not bad – just different, sweeter, with a sharp undertone that is unfamiliar to him. Even tepid, it makes a strange heat blossom in his chest, and Lan Huan decides he likes it. It makes him feel warm. He downs the rest of his tea.</p><p>Sect Leader Jiang looks down at his own mug, shrugs and raises it to his own mouth. He takes a sip. Then swears.</p><p>“That’s not tea.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jiang Cheng is going to <em>kill</em> Wei Wuxian. He’s going to stab him right between the ribs, then tie his adopted brother up with Zidian and set the lightning on ‘high’. After that, he’s going to hang the dumbass over a nice, toasty campfire and roast him slowly.</p><p>The idiot has put <em>wine</em> in the jar. Not even the expensive stuff; no, this is the dirt-cheap swill that gets sold in roadside stalls with an alcohol content of too fucking much, and now Zewu-Jun, the First Jade of Gusu, the leader of the Lan sect and the highest-ranked cultivator in the whole damn world is drinking it.</p><p>The poor sod in question doesn’t even know the kind of trash he’s putting into his body, just sitting there holding his fucking gigantic mug – who even owns cups that big? – and staring at Jiang Cheng like he’s never fucking tasted alcohol in his life.</p><p>“Oh,” he says mildly, those dark gold eyes wider and more innocent than any grown man’s have a right to be.</p><p>Then Jiang Cheng remembers something Wei Wuxian told him a couple months ago about how he and Hanguang-Jun had gotten together. In between the kissing and the touching and the parts Jiang Cheng really wanted to scrub from his memory forever, there had been a few things that stood out.</p><p>
    <em>Alcohol, like literally everything else that’s fun in this world, is prohibited in Cloud Recesses. So naturally, the Lans have shit alcohol tolerance.</em>
    </p><p>With Jiang Cheng’s luck, this actually is the first time Sect Leader Lan has touched any form of alcohol whatsoever. And it’s all his fault. Well, technically, it’s Wei Wuxian’s, but Jiang Cheng was the one who delivered the jar, and now any and all consequences are going to come down on his head because that’s the way the world works and <em>he’s so fucking screwed</em>.</p><p>“Oh,” Lan Xichen repeats.</p><p>He sets the mug down, now empty, and gets to his feet. He sways a little, unsteady, then his eyes roll back in his head, his eyelids flutter closed and he pitches forward, completely fucking unconscious.</p><p>Jiang Cheng scrambles to his feet just in time to catch the taller man as he falls.</p><p>Zewu-Jun is as limp as a rag doll and weighs about a ton, because underneath all those yards of pristine white cloth, he’s muscled like a racehorse. His chest is solid against Jiang Cheng’s, and when his arms come up to steady the other man, his fingers skim over hills and valleys of taut muscles in his back.</p><p>The Yunmeng Jiang sect leader is suddenly very aware of every inch of Lan Xichen’s warm body pressed against his, the huffing breaths against the side of his neck where Zewu-Jun’s head is slumped, the scent of roses and peonies from the garden outside that clings to his clothes.</p><p>No one has touched Jiang Cheng in a very long time, and never like this, pressed full-body up against another human being. It’s so very <em>warm</em>, and his pulse rockets through his veins. For a moment, the icy fire within him dies away, replaced by a feeling like sitting beside a fireplace in wintertime.</p><p>Then he realises what’s going on. He’s got another man in his fucking arms, passed-out drunk from one mug of cheap wine, and this is <em>not</em> a situation Jiang Cheng ever thought he’d be in. Automatically, he lets go.</p><p>Lan Xichen drops like a stone, hitting the floor with a loud ‘thunk’. A feeling a little like guilt settles in his stomach, and Jiang Cheng winces in sympathy. That’s going to hurt like a bitch when he wakes up tomorrow.</p><p><em>What am I going to do now?</em>, he thinks to himself.</p><p>“Fuck,” is what he says out loud.</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>For the next few minutes, Jiang Cheng just sort of hovers awkwardly over Lan Xichen as his brain goes into panic-mode. Inwardly, he’s running through a list of all his misdemeanors ever since he’s arrived here at Cloud Recesses, and said list is frighteningly long.</p><p>Breaking Zewu-Jun’s seclusion without prior notice of visitation – not once but twice, if his last visit is to be counted. Drinking in Cloud Recesses, getting Sect Leader Lan <em>drunk</em> in Cloud Recesses… It goes on.</p><p>Finally, Jiang Cheng recovers his head and tells himself to calm the fuck down. He’s not a damn disciple anymore. He’s a grown man, for gods’ sake, a war veteran and sect leader – this behaviour is absolutely disgraceful.</p><p>Jiang Cheng takes a deep breath and, now calmer, looks back down at the unconscious man lying on the floor in front of him. His neck is bent at an uncomfortable angle, head lolling towards his shoulder, and one of his arms is squashed beneath him. It’s a terrible position to be in, and Lan Xichen is undoubtedly going to be sore tomorrow if he spends the night like this.</p><p>The guilt sitting in Jiang Cheng’s gut grows a little heavier at the thought. Damn his conscience. He should have shut it up long ago.</p><p>(Frankly, he’s surprised he still has one, after all the shit he’s put it through over the years. Its reappearance is unexpected, but not entirely unwelcome.)</p><p>Jiang Cheng should leave the other man here, he really should. Excessive physical contact is probably another one of the many things that are prohibited in Cloud Recesses, and if Lan Xichen is anything like his brother, he’ll freak the fuck out if he discovers that Jiang Cheng has so much as poked him in his sleep.</p><p>Jiang Cheng tries to convince himself that it would bother him, too, to touch Zewu-Jun, even to carry him back to bed where he’d be more comfortable. He resolutely refuses to think about whether the attempt is effective.</p><p>In the end, he settles on a compromise. He’s not going to princess-carry Sect Leader Lan into his bedroom – that would be embarrassing for the both of them, not to mention the fact that even with Jiang Cheng’s considerable strength, Lan Xichen is really fucking heavy.</p><p>Instead, he grabs a couple cushions from the reading area over by the bookshelves. Without thinking too much about what he’s doing, Jiang Cheng lifts the other man’s head off the floor and shoves one under his neck.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s woken up on the floor enough to know that too much time spent on hard surfaces is hell on your tailbone. If he’s going to do this, he might as well go the whole hog.</p><p>He turns Lan Xichen over – just a little bit, enough to free the arm trapped under his body – and places the other cushion under his waist. Then, he steps back and surveys his handiwork. The position the taller man is in, though far from ideal, is at the very least much more comfortable than his initial state.</p><p>The guilty feeling lessens a little, but it doesn’t go away completely.</p><p>Sighing, he gets to his feet, collects the two mugs and the jar, and enters the kitchen. The tiny space is, as expected, very neat – a reflection of Lan Xichen himself. There are dishes drying on a wooden rack next to the sink, herbs growing in baskets suspended from the ceiling in places where the light would fall through the window during daytime.</p><p>The whole place smells of rosemary and thyme, and a hint of basil, though Jiang Cheng isn’t quite sure what they’re all are doing here. Gusu cuisine is famous for its blandess and lack of strong flavour, and these herbs are basically the opposite of that.</p><p>He sets the jar down next to the sink and begins to rinse out the mugs. Once that is done, he sets them aside to dry and opens the ceramic jar that caused all this trouble in the first place.</p><p>The smell of cheap liquor, probably distilled in someone’s basement, assails his nose. It’s strong and suspiciously sweet, and Jiang Cheng holds it closer to his face, far enough away so that he doesn’t choke on the fumes.</p><p>His idiot of an older brother added copious amounts of syrup to the wine, probably thinking that it would cover up the taste of alcohol, especially to someone who had never tried it before. Absolutely disgusting. Jiang Cheng shakes his head, renewing his vow to skewer Wei Wuxian the next time he sees him.</p><p>Then he upends the damn jar over the sink, watching the brown liquid sluice down the drain, and rinses the entire container out for good measure. Judging from Lan Xichen’s face while he was drinking the ‘tea’ earlier, the other man had actually <em>enjoyed</em> that shit. Jiang Cheng supposes it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>Fucking Lans. They’re all insane, the whole lot of them. (He’s lost count of the number of times he’s thought that.)</p><p>A noise outside in the living room draws Jiang Cheng’s attention. His hand briefly slips on the wet surface of the jar, but he manages to catch it before it falls and shatters in the sink.</p><p><em>Oh, no</em>. What’s happening now? This night is just one disaster after another with no respite in between, and Jiang Cheng thinks it might actually be a good idea to curl up into a ball and die.</p><p>But of course, he can’t do that.</p><p>He sets the jar down on the counter with the mugs and dashes outside again, praying that nothing too catastrophic has yet occurred.</p><p>He’s been here before, he knows. This is almost like when Jin Ling was a toddler and breaking things left and right, putting the rest in his mouth so he could see what they were. The only way to keep the brat out of trouble was to hold him at all times, but little kids <em>squirm</em>, and if Jiang Cheng set him down for so much as a second, he crawled off at the speed of light and had to be hunted down before he destroyed something important.</p><p>But this isn’t his baby nephew. This is a very buff, very grown adult man whose cultivation level is even higher than Jiang Cheng’s own, and the number of things that could potentially go wrong in this scenario is so very astronomical that Jiang Cheng wants to hit something.</p><p>When he gets to the living room, Lan Xichen is already upright, his hand pressed against the wall for support. The cushions are in a heap on the floor. The other man’s liquid gold eyes are wide open and blinking against the light, and he’s looking at Jiang Cheng with a curious expression on his face that for some reason sends shivers down his spine.</p><p>Oh, good, he’s awake. No wonder – it was just one mug of wine; it couldn’t have kept him knocked out for very long. Now they can go back to normal and pretend this never happened.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang,” he chirps cheerfully, and Jiang Cheng freezes. Because first, no one who calls him by that title has ever sounded so happy to see him, and second, at this precise moment, Zewu-Jun sounds exactly like Lan Jingyi high on chicken wings and too much sugar. (Don’t ask him how he knows that. Please. Just don’t.)</p><p>Then the ever-graceful, perpetually poised Lan Xichen takes a step towards him and staggers a bit, righting himself only after a few seconds. His smile is even more blinding than usual, lips curled across those perfectly white teeth, but Jiang Cheng’s heart sinks.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>, he thinks, for what may be the thousandth time tonight. Sect Leader Lan is absolutely shitfaced.</p><p> </p>
    <hr/><p> </p><p> </p>
    <p>His head is spinning as he takes a step towards the man in purple. No, that doesn’t seem quite right. His head can’t be spinning on top of his neck – that doesn’t make any sense. The world must be spinning instead, twirling around like the top he taught Wangji to play with when they were small. Yes, that’s much better.</p><p>Everything feels floaty and light, like the inside of a cloud. All the things that hurt inside him are gone, floated away, or maybe they’re not gone – just covered up by clouds until he can pretend they’re not there anymore.</p><p>Lan Huan likes clouds, he thinks.</p><p>The man in purple looks angry, and something else. His eyebrows are drawn down to a crease in the middle of his forehead, and his pretty mouth is set in a downward slash.</p><p>Worried, Lan Huan realises. The man looks worried.</p><p>That’s not right.</p><p>Lan Huan wants to tell the man not to be sad, because everything feels nice and okay, and sadness isn’t nice or okay at all. He doesn’t like it when people are sad. He wants the man to smile, because he looks like he’d be really pretty when he smiles, and because then he won’t be sad anymore.</p><p>Dimly, he thinks that’s not true. People who smile can also be sad, and sometimes looking happy covers up the deepest, darkest sadness of all.</p><p>But then the thought gets swallowed back up by the white, fluffy clouds and everything feels good again.</p><p> </p>
    <hr/><p> </p><p> </p>
    <p>When Jiang Cheng’s brain regains full function, the first thing he registers is that Lan Xichen’s forehead ribbon is crooked. No, not exactly; it had been crooked before. It’s almost completely undone now, and Lan Xichen’s bangs, normally tucked neatly underneath it, are escaping in long black wisps.</p><p>The second thing is that the man in question is staring at him intently, as if trying to decipher a puzzle. That focused stare is completely at odds with the wide grin on his face, and Jiang Cheng is instantly on edge.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang,” the other man repeats. “Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>He tilts his head to the side like a confused bird.</p><p>“Your forehead ribbon is crooked.”</p><p>“Oh!”, Lan Xichen exclaims, and reaches around the back of his head to grasp the ribbon. He gives it an experimental tug, and the thing comes apart in his hand.</p><p>It’s long and white, patterned with light blue threaded clouds, and Zewu-Jun stares at it for a moment before wrapping it around his forehead and attempting to tie it back. Though his fingers are long and dexterous from years of playing the <em>guqin</em>, he eventually loses to the alcohol he downed only minutes ago and gives up after a few failed tries.</p><p>But he doesn’t let that faze him. The Lan sect leader turns his gaze and that smile back on Jiang Cheng, and it’s like he’s hit over the head with the force of it.</p><p>“It seems that I am unable to accomplish this task at the moment. Would you help me?”</p><p>Lan Xichen holds out the ribbon, and Jiang Cheng has no choice but to take it. It’s either that or say no to another sect leader, and that would probably look exceedingly rude. Anyway, it’s not like it’s <em>hard</em>. He ties his own hair back all the time, and he was the one to tie Jin Ling’s until the kid was old enough to do it himself.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has heard that the Gusu Lan sect members attach some sort of special significance to their forehead ribbons, but for the life of him, he can’t remember what it is. He just hopes he hasn’t committed a mortal offense by touching one, as he winds the long strip of cloth around the other man’s forehead and ties a knot.</p><p>“There,” he says roughly, trying to salvage what’s left of his dignity. It’s in shreds by this point, so he’s not sure whether it matters. “Done.”</p><p>Zewu-Jun brings a hand up to his forehead and feels the ribbon, then follows it to the back of his head and fiddles with the knot. Seemingly satisfied, he thanks Jiang Cheng, and then…</p><p>And then he grabs Jiang Cheng’s hand and drags him outside.</p><p>Like all cultivators, Lan Xichen has calloused hands from hours of sword practice and in his case, playing the <em>guqin</em> and <em>xiao</em> every day for years. They are warm and strong, and though the feeling of someone else’s hand in his is unfamiliar, Jiang Cheng finds that it is not entirely unpleasant.</p><p>“Look at the sky,” the other man says. “Isn’t it beautiful?”</p><p>Overhead, the moon is barely visible. While the new moon passed a few nights ago and the yellow outline is fattening steadily, little of it can be seen behind the wispy clouds gathering in the distance. It will rain soon, in three days at most, but for now the weather remains clear.</p><p>“I suppose so.”</p><p>Then the warm grip disappears from around Jiang Cheng’s hand. Startled, he watches as Lan Xichen <em>leaps</em> from the ground up onto the fucking roof. He wobbles there for a moment, regaining his balance, then totters on over to the beam in the centre where the roof’s sloping sides meet in a peak.</p><p>“Get down from there!”, Jiang Cheng yells. But Lan Xichen doesn’t listen.</p><p>The highest-ranked cultivator in the entire world steps on the wooden beam and puts one foot in front of the other, arms flung out and tongue between his teeth like a little kid who’s been dared to walk the edge of the gutter.</p><p><em>Oh, gods in heaven. He’s going to get himself killed</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng jumps up onto the roof behind him and grabs Zewu-Jun’s arm, pulling him down until he has no choice but to collapse into a sitting position, his ass parked on the beam and his legs dangling over the side of the roof.</p><p>“Sect Leader Lan, you should probably stay here,” says Jiang Cheng, his voice unsteady.</p><p>He feels as though he’s talking to a particularly disobedient dog. He has no idea what the other man is going to do next. It might even be something that could get them both killed.</p><p>“The stars are so bright tonight. Can’t you see them?”</p><p>“Mmhmm.”</p><p>“The clouds are pretty, too. Like you,” Lan Xichen says. Jiang Cheng’s brain short-circuits. “You’re pretty.”</p><p><em>What the fuck?</em> All that alcohol must have fried something in the other sect leader’s head, because there is no way any self-respecting man would ever be caught dead saying something like that, drunk or sober. Even Jiang Cheng’s mother would have sooner started whacking people with Zidian.</p><p>Heat rushes into Jiang Cheng’s face, and it feels like he’s burning. He’s pretty sure his cheeks have gone as red as Jin Ling’s did a few days ago, though it’s probably well hidden by the moonlight.</p><p>Jiang Cheng remembers being amused by his nephew’s embarrassment then. <em>Karma is a bitch</em>, he thinks. Well, he’s not laughing now.</p><p>Zewu-Jun must be so fucking wasted right now, if he’s saying things like that. It’s the only logical explanation. People spout weird shit all the time when they’re drunk.</p><p>The taller man doesn’t seem to notice Jiang Cheng’s indignant sputtering. Instead, his gaze is drawn to the silver bell tied to his waist, shaped like a nine-petaled lotus flower and shining in the moonlight. The symbol of the Yunmeng Jiang sect. His sect.</p><p>Jiang Cheng only figures out Lan Xichen’s interested in the thing when an arm shoots out and grabs at it. His fingers are clumsy and Jiang Cheng bats him away easily, but by this time, his heart is hammering in his throat and he can’t control the jittery feeling thrumming through his body.</p><p>“Please don’t touch that.”</p><p>His voice is soft. Most people might say it’s a dangerous sound, but right now, Jiang Cheng doesn’t feel very dangerous. His skin feels too tight for him and his hands are shivery; there’s something crawling up his spine that feels like panic and something he can’t name.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Lan Xichen’s doing the confused head-tilt thing again, eyes trained on Jiang Cheng’s face like he holds the secrets to the entire universe. He sounds excited, and curious, and Jiang Cheng figures screw it, it’s not like it’s a secret anyway. He takes a deep breath.</p><p>“The bells… For people from Yunmeng, the bells we wear are very special to us. They represent our family: those we have lost in the past, those closest to us now, and those we will love in times to come. The bell is something very… personal to many of us, especially my family.”</p><p>Lan Xichen nods carefully. He’s an intent listener, and it feels like he understands Jiang Cheng’s shitty, halting explanation. He can tell he’s not doing a great job, but he forges on ahead regardless.</p><p>“Giving your bell to someone is a sign of deep…” – here, he struggles with the words – “… love, and affection for the recipient. Trust, as well. When my sister married Jin Zixuan, she gave him hers to wear during the ceremony.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s throat hurts suddenly, as if he has a cold, and he has to swallow a few times before it goes away.</p><p>The wedding had been beautiful, his sister laughing and radiant in her red dress, looking up at her new husband with such complete love and adoration in her eyes as he pushed back her scarlet veil and clasped her hands in his. Wei Wuxian had tried not to cry when the gilded peacock he’d made fun of for months promised to protect their Ah-Jie for the rest of their lives, and Jiang Cheng had only sniffled a bit as he watched the two of them bow to the tiny figurines of the gods and the markers that represented their parents.</p><p>Now, seventeen years older and exactly jack shit wiser, Jiang Cheng knows he’ll never have that. He’ll never stand in front of an altar with his hands by his sides and his pulse pounding in his ears, and see a glint of silver – his – against red robes as the person he loves walks towards him.</p><p>He’ll never have that, because everyone he’s ever loved has walked away instead. All he knows how to give is anger, and so he’ll keep his bell and his heart because no one will take them.</p><p>Jiang Cheng feels a calloused hand pat his a few times, and he remembers that Lan Xichen is an older brother too, used to giving care and comfort, even to someone as stonefaced as Lan Wangji.</p><p>“The stars are bright tonight,” Zewu-Jun repeats. Then he rests his head on Jiang Cheng’s shoulder and closes his eyes.</p>

          <p>So thanks to one of the amazing reviewers for this story (much gratitude), I have realised that the short depiction of the wedding in this chapter is rather too westernised for a Chinese ceremony, and have attempted to correct this error. It's probably still way out of whack, so please tell me if I've gotten yet more stuff wrong.</p><p>Disclaimer: I am half-Chinese, but also what you'd call a 'third-culture kid', so I know next to nothing about traditional Chinese weddings and (this one is my own fault) have not done any research.</p><p>Also, the bit about the bells was not completely my idea. I have seen in a few other fanfics (I can't call them to mind right now, but there were more than one) that some writers have run with the idea that the Yunmeng Jiang sect bells are special in the same way that the Gusu Lan sect forehead ribbons are, and though I can't recall exactly what they represent and have done my own interpretation of the idea, I cannot take full credit for it. Neither is this canon, but I hope you enjoyed it anyway.</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t know how he gets through the rest of the night. After that moment, it’s all kind of a blur, honestly.</p><p>What happens is that Zewu-Jun falls asleep against Jiang Cheng’s shoulder, and no amount of shaking will wake the other man up. He realises that this means it’s probably nine o’ clock now, and Lan Xichen isn’t going to budge until five tomorrow morning, unless Jiang Cheng moves him himself.</p><p>Which is not going to happen. Jiang Cheng swears on Zidian, Sandu and all the gods he worships – including a few he doesn’t – that that is not going to happen.</p><p>He sits on the roof, ass going numb and fingers losing circulation due to the night-time early spring chill, the First Jade of the Gusu Lan sect fucking <em>sleeping</em> on him (it’s the only warm spot, but he refuses to shift closer). Lan Xichen can fall off the roof for all he cares. He’s not going to move. Absolutely not.</p><p>In the end, Jiang Cheng lasts about fifteen minutes before he gives in.</p><p>As he throws Lan Xichen over his shoulder – he may be behaving like a softhearted wuss, but he has <em>lines</em>, damnit; he’s not going to carry him like a fucking bride over the threshold – he thinks wryly that there might be a few reasons that Jin Ling is the way he is. And not all of them have to do with the fact that he’s related to Jin Guangshan.</p><p>The drop back down to solid ground is a short one, as the cottage is rather low. But with the added weight of a passenger, the landing is harder than Jiang Cheng expects, and the impact makes his knees buckle a little. The other man doesn’t even shift in his sleep, and Jiang Cheng thanks the heavens for small mercies.</p><p>The last thing he needs – either of them need – is for Lan Xichen to wake up and notice the position they’re in. It would hardly be dignified for Sect Leader Lan to find himself thrown over another man’s shoulder like a sack of potatoes, and even more mortifying that Jiang Cheng is the one carrying him.</p><p>He struggles a bit getting them through the doorway and into the cottage – the opening is narrow and there are two of them. Going single-file isn’t quite possible, either, considering that one of them is unconscious. Someone’s head bumps against the doorframe, and Jiang Cheng’s pretty sure he’s going to have a bruised elbow tomorrow, but finally they’re in the house, almost none the worse for wear.</p><p>Sect Leader Lan is over an inch taller than Jiang Cheng, so the toes of his boots drag on the floor as the smaller man wanders all over the cottage trying to find the bedroom. The floor plan is tiny and Jiang Cheng has little difficulty, but it might have been nice to be informed beforehand.</p><p>Not that Jiang Cheng has any desire to go into Zewu-Jun’s bedroom. None at all. Poking around in another cultivator’s sleeping quarters – especially a fellow sect leader – is rude and improper. It goes against everything Jiang Cheng was raised to be.</p><p>Jiang Fengmian spent years ingraining in him the manners a sect leader was supposed to have, the proper way to treat other cultivators. Jiang Cheng admits that over the years, he’s ignored many of those lessons, but he’s always tried to make his father proud. He’s not sure that the man woud be, if he could see his son now.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jiang Cheng can’t exactly let Sect Leader Lan sleep on the floor in his own house. It’s partly his fault that they’re in this mess.</p><p>He knows his older brother – he should have at least checked the jar for suspicious substances before he handed it over. And anyway, he’s already brought the other man down off the roof. Might as well bring him the last few feet into his own bed.</p><p>They come to the door that opens into the room where Lan Xichen sleeps. Like the rest of the cottage, it’s small and tidy. Bookshelves line the walls, stacked with scrolls rolled neatly up and tied with blue ribbons. A <em>guqin</em> leans against one of the shelves, meticulously polished, the strings shining in the light.</p><p>On a little nightstand next to the bed, Jiang Cheng spots Zewu-Jun’s famous <em>xiao</em>, Liebing. Its carved white jade surface looks innocuous, but he’s pretty sure that the flute’s owner is perfectly capable of killing someone with it, if he so chose.</p><p>Not for the first time, Jiang Cheng wishes he had any scrap of musical talent whatsoever.</p><p>Growing up, he’d been incredibly jealous as Wei Wuxian mastered one instrument after another, able even to command the dead by playing a single tune on his <em>dizi</em>. Jiang Cheng, however, could only make a sound like a dying chicken the few times he’d tried.</p><p>When he became frustrated and the noise worsened as he blew harder, Ah-Jie laid a graceful hand on the bamboo flute. She smiled gently and suggested that maybe his talents lay in other directions, then asked if he’d like some lotus root and pork rib soup.</p><p>That was the first time the sweet liquid had been cloying on his tongue, and Jiang Cheng swallowed the bitterness he thought he could taste. He chewed on the lotus roots instead, and politely refused when Ah-Jie offered both him and his brother seconds.</p><p>Jiang Cheng can sing, though. It’s not like he can use it as a weapon, and so it’s also not something he’s ever told anyone, even his brother, who would be suitably impressed but cover it up with a flippant remark that singing is for girls. He doesn’t need to hear that, and anyway, it’s nice to have something about himself that no one else knows.</p><p>When Jin Ling was younger and crying because he missed his parents, Jiang Cheng had sung to him. Wordless tunes, children’s songs he remembered vaguely from his own scattered childhood, anything and everything that came to mind, until the sobbing kid went back to sleep.</p><p>Jin Ling doesn’t remember any of this, of course. Otherwise Jiang Cheng might have to beat it out of him.</p><p>(He’s not serious about that, obviously. He’d never actually lay a hand on his nephew. The constant threats to break his legs are just that – threats, and even the brat knows it.)</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks away from the <em>xiao</em>. Rather ungracefully, he lets Lan Xichen fall onto the bed, and after a few minutes of arguing with himself, finally kneels down and pulls off the other sect leader’s boots before arranging them neatly at the foot of the bed.</p><p>He’s not a fucking nanny, and the fact that he’s doing this for another man even older than him is just downright embarrassing. His only consolation is that if Wei Wuxian’s stories are anything to go by, Sect Leader Lan won’t remember any of this in the morning.</p><p>But for some reason, that thought isn’t as reassuring as it should be.</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks down at the unconscious man, laid out on top of his covers in what probably isn’t his natural sleeping position. Lan Xichen’s well-defined features are slack and relaxed with sleep, the corners of his mouth tilted upwards even now from years of smiling at everyone around him. His braid has flopped over one ear, and covers nearly a quarter of his face.</p><p>It’s easy to see why this man ranks highest on the list of male cultivators, and has done for years. Jiang Cheng can’t really begrudge him the position.</p><p>Zewu-Jun probably has hundreds of women throwing themselves at him. Over the years, Jiang Cheng has heard the increasingly outrageous stories of marriage proposals that circulate like wildfire, centering on the First Jade of Gusu. Some of them are actually really fucking funny – nearly as disastrous as his own failed matchmaking attempts – and have provided him with hours of amusement.</p><p>He wonders if Lan Xichen has spent nearly as much time laughing at the rumours about <em>him</em>. Doubtful. Sect Leader Lan is too damn polite to do something as crass as delight at another poor sod’s misfortune. Joke’s on him – that’s where Jiang Cheng gets most of his entertainment these days.</p><p>That’s probably not it either. The other man most likely doesn’t spend any time thinking about him at all, not that he should. Years of political gatherings and one or two civil interactions do not a friendship make. Even though they’re kind-of-sort-of brothers-in-law now.</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t even know why he’s thinking about this. It’s not like he cares.</p><p>He spots a calligraphy brush lying across a pad of paper on the tiny desk next to the door. There’s an inkpot in the top left corner. It will have to do. He pens a short message to Lan Xichen, and blows on it a couple times for good measure. Then he leaves it on the man’s nightstand, weighing it down with the <em>xiao</em>, for him to find in the morning.</p><p>He exits the cottage immediately after, without a backward glance.</p><p>It’s a short walk back to his quarters, but by the time he enters the building that houses all the visiting sect leaders, most of the lights are out. Jin Ling’s is as well, which is natural, Jiang Cheng supposes. The next meeting is early tomorrow morning, and though his nephew made a valiant effort not to show it, the journey up from Lotus Pier was a long one.</p><p>It might also have something to do with their surroundings. The Lan sleeping habits seem to be contagious, since even the clan leaders Jiang Cheng knows usually stay up long past midnight look to have made an effort to turn in early.</p><p>Staying as silent as possible – which is pretty damn quiet, thanks to the practice he’s had with his usual habits – Jiang Cheng lets himself into his rooms and lights a couple lamps, washing himself quickly before finishing up his usual end-of-day ritual.</p><p>He normally rinses his hair in the mornings, so all he does tonight is remove the pins and cloth that hold it in its usual severe bun. Runs a brush through it to work the tangles out, and ties a loose braid to keep it out of his face in his sleep.</p><p>That done, he tackles the short stack of papers that has piled up on a corner of the desk. He might be away from home, but the duties of a sect leader never cease. The clan elder he’s tasked with running things in his absence has sent him a report of the day’s events, and he skims it.</p><p>Nothing important. The other letters all continue in the same vein and finally, half an hour later, he’s done.</p><p>Jiang Cheng blows the lamps out and crawls into bed. The mattress is unfamiliar but not uncomfortable; at any rate, however bad it could be, he’s slept on worse. A sect leader he may be, but during the Sunshot Campaign, no one had the time or energy to spend on luxuries. He bedded down on the ground in the tents like everyone else, and didn’t complain about it.</p><p>His thoughts turn to the day’s events.</p><p>The meeting went well – as well as could be expected, as he’s already established in his numerous discussions with people who were not present at the time. He’ll have to talk to Jin Ling about it later, see if the brat’s learned anything. At least he looked like he was paying attention during the gathering. Perhaps Jiang Cheng will quiz him on it.</p><p>His nephew’s eighteenth birthday is only drawing closer and he needs to be prepared when that happens. He knows Jin Ling, with the shortsightedness of the very young, thinks it’s far away yet, but a year is not a long time, and the cultivation world is a hard one for a young man on his own.</p><p>What is he going to do, when Jin Ling becomes the Lanling Jin sect leader in more than name and finally moves to Koi Tower?</p><p>In his head, he knows that he’ll continue with his own duties and life will go on, but somewhere in his chest, he can’t shake the hollow feeling that eats away at him when he thinks about how empty Lotus Pier will be without the boy he’s raised. Without the shrieking and childish laughter, and Fairy’s barking as he chases Jin Ling through the halls.</p><p>It’s odd, and so fucking ironic that he thinks he’d laugh if it didn’t make him want to scream. Seventeen and a single father he hadn’t planned on being, all Jiang Cheng had thought was <em>what am I going to do with this kid?</em> Now he’s thirty-four, and the only thing going around in his mind is <em>what am I going to do without him?</em></p><p>He turns over on his side so he’s facing the window. He can see the sky outside, and the words he heard over an hour ago echo in his ears.</p><p><em>The stars are bright tonight</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has never been close to Lan Xichen, but somehow, the words feel like hope. He whispers them to himself, and they ease the ache in his chest.</p>

    <p>When Lan Huan’s biological clock forces his eyes open at five in the morning, he feels, simply put, like death warmed over. There’s a pounding in his head that throbs in perfect sync with his pulse, his eyes feel like they’ve been dipped in glue and allowed to crust over, and his mouth tastes cottony and foul, as if a small animal crawled onto his tongue and decided to expire.</p><p>He rolls over in bed, too uncomfortable to get up just yet. The sudden movement makes the earth tilt and a sharp bolt of pain flare through his skull. Lan Huan bites the inside of his cheek until it passes.</p><p>His stomach is roiling as it hasn’t been since he discovered he was allergic to shellfish and spent an entire weekend bent over a chamber pot. But Lan Huan hates vomiting, hates the loss of control and the feeling of his stomach muscles spasming, so he swallows a few times and tries to force his innards to calm. The dryness of his mouth makes the task rather difficult.</p><p>It’s another few minutes before he feels any sort of confidence whatsoever that he can move without the contents of his insides making their way outside. Finally, he pushes himself up off the bed and gets hesitantly to his feet.</p><p>The short journey to the bathroom makes his headache intensify, and though Lan Huan’s night vision is better than decent, he still has to light a lamp in order to see.</p><p>The inevitable brightening of the small room sends little lightning bolts sparking behind his eyes. It is this newest discomfort that finally pushes Lan Huan’s sleep-fogged brain to the realisation that no, this pain is not normal.</p><p>Is he coming down with something?</p><p>He presses a hand to his forehead in much the same way as he used to do with Wangji when they were children and his little brother was sick. Though the skin feels cool against his aching forehead, his temperature is no higher than normal.</p><p>Why, then, does he feel so truly terrible?</p><p>He runs through the symptoms he has experienced since he woke up. Dry mouth, headache, aversion to light… And the last thing he remembers from the night before: downing a glass of sweet liquid that felt warm in his chest, and Jiang Wanyin’s deep voice saying “that’s not tea”.</p><p>Lan Huan has never uttered a single curse in his entire adult life (not counting his short-lived teenage rebellious phase) and he is not about to start now, but the absurdity of the situation is admittedly taxing his self-control.</p><p>From what he can tell, everything he is currently experiencing is the result of alcohol consumption. A hangover, as most people call it. And as his uncle would say, the aftermath of a terribly stupid, ill-conceived, uncultured action.</p><p>He splashes water on his face, rinsing his mouth with it as well. The cool liquid does make him feel better, though the light is still piercing when he opens his eyes to blink away the water.</p><p>Lan Huan washes up quickly, then moves back out into the bedroom, lighting a few more lamps to see by. He is surprised by what he finds.</p><p>His boots have been arranged neatly at the foot of the bed, though he can’t find the robes he wore yesterday anywhere. He looks down at himself. <em>Oh</em>, he thinks. He’s still wearing them.</p><p>In the kitchen, the two mugs he retrieved last night have been washed thoroughly and are now sitting on the drying rack. The ceramic jar, as well, has been cleansed of all incriminating traces of alcohol.</p><p>Lan Huan’s rooms are perfectly in order, his things are arranged neatly, and it is obvious that he had no part in any of it. He normally places his boots adjacent to the wall before he goes to sleep, and without fail, always puts the dried dishes away in the cupboard for the night. He is also wearing yesterday’s robes, which is something he usually avoids doing, if he can help it.</p><p>It is becoming abundantly clear that whatever happened last night, Jiang Wanyin was the one to deal with the aftermath. Probably also the one who had helped him to bed, if the awkward position he had woken up in was any indicator. Lan Huan generally doesn’t move in his sleep.</p><p>An image abruptly comes to mind, of the dour-faced sect leader bustling around in his tiny kitchen, drying dishes like a kitchen maid. Tugging his boots off in the middle of the night.</p><p>Lan Huan’s face flushes with embarrassment, and he thanks some unknown power that there is no one around to see.</p><p><em>What happened last night?</em> Did he do anything humiliating? The entire sequence of events is a mystery to him – a massive black blank that begins after he’d taken that drink, and ends with him waking up in his bed with the headache to end all others.</p><p>Did he–? No, a quick check reveals he’s still wearing his trousers.</p><p>Then Lan Huan berates himself for even thinking that a possibility. He has more self-respect than to sleep with a near-total stranger while intoxicated – or at least, he thinks he does – and Sect Leader Jiang doesn’t seem the type to take advantage of a man not in complete control of his faculties. Yell at and lose his temper with, yes, but not… other things.</p><p>He meanders back into his bedroom and for the first time, catches sight of a small piece of paper on his desk, weighted down by Liebing. It’s a note, left by Sandu-Shengshou.</p><p><em>Sect Leader Lan, </em>it reads in large, bold writing that looks vaguely familiar, <em>I apologise for tonight’s events.</em></p><p>That does not sound good. Of course, it could mean any number of things. He decides to read on. Knowledge is better than ignorance, in all cases but a few.</p><p>
    <em>I had not known that the jar I brought you contained a rather strong wine, and was under the impression that it contained tea instead. I assure you, I will be having words with my brother – and your brother-in-law – as he was undoubtedly the one behind this.</em>
    </p><p>At that, Lan Huan cannot help the sigh he lets out. Of course it was Wei Wuxian. Even with twenty other sect leaders in attendance, no one in Cloud Recesses loves mischief-making as much as the former Yiling Patriarch. Though Lan Huan has absolutely no idea what would possess him to do such a thing.</p><p>
    <em>Having been informed of the responses of members of the Gusu Lan sect to alcohol: in the event that you remember nothing from tonight, I feel obliged to let you know that nothing untoward happened this evening. However, it might be wise to avoid liquor in the future, should you wish to preserve your reputation.</em>
    </p><p>The note ends with those ominous words, signed off with the man’s courtesy name scrawled hastily below. The meaning itself is innocuous, seemingly a piece of friendly advice between colleagues, but the tone is warning. Almost threatening.</p><p>If what Jiang Wanyin says is to be believed, nothing happened last night – at least, nothing that would hurt him or his sect if it were to get out. (Lan Huan is assuming here that the two of them have similar definitions of the word ‘untoward’.) So why would Sect Leader Jiang threaten him?</p><p>And why now? What would be the purpose of menacing another sect leader at a gathering meant to promote inter-sect unity? It makes little sense. The churning in his stomach is slowly fading away, only to be replaced by the cold, slimy feeling of dread.</p><p>
    <em>What did he do last night?</em>
    </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>For once, Jiang Cheng’s nightmares don’t wake him. Instead, he’s dragged reluctantly into consciousness by the sound of the door opening. He doesn’t even have time to open his eyes before his nephew’s voice fills the room, banishing the last dregs of sleep.</p><p>“Uncle, what are you doing still in bed? The next meeting starts in half an hour!”</p><p>Jiang Cheng starts at that. <em>Aw, fuck</em>, he thinks as he looks out the window to find sunlight streaming in. That was the best sleep he’s had in ages, and <em>this</em> is what he wakes up to? Oh, well.</p><p>Jin Ling is standing near the doorway, his arms crossed over his chest, features set in a scowl. He taps his foot impatiently, looking every inch the young master, and Jiang Cheng bristles.</p><p>He’s the adult here; where does his nephew get off talking to him like that?</p><p>“Don’t take that tone with me, young man,” he says, but the effect is somewhat spoiled by a barely-repressed yawn.</p><p>“Sorry, uncle.”</p><p>At Jing Ling’s contrite expression, Jiang Cheng turns his fury onto a more appropriate target.</p><p>“That fucking dumbass,” he mutters, as he dresses hurriedly. He checks the time – no, he’s running too late for a bath. He’ll just have to wait until the meeting is over. This is all his brother’s fault. If he hadn’t pulled that stupid stunt last night–</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng shrugs on his outermost robe, buckles his belt and glares at his nephew.</p><p>“Wei Wuxian. I swear, when I see that little bastard again, I’m going to kill him.”</p><p>The sudden change in topic seems to have left Jin Ling reeling. His brows furrow in confusion, and he suddenly looks exactly like Jin Zixuan after one of their more successful pranks.</p><p>“What does that have to do with anything?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng snorts. “Don’t ask stupid questions. Lesson number one: anything that goes wrong, anything at all, is almost always Wei Wuxian’s fault.”</p><p>“I still don’t get–”</p><p>“Please, just shut up.”</p><p>Ignoring Jin Ling’s affronted expression, he yanks the door open and makes a mocking ‘after you’ gesture that doubles in meaning as ‘get the fuck out of here’. Once the kid is out of the room, he grabs Sandu and buckles on his sword belt, then walks out into the hallway, locking the door behind him.</p><p>They’re cutting it close, but they manage to make it to the pavilion mere minutes before the designated meeting time. From the looks of it, they’re not the last ones there either. A few of the sect leaders used to later hours shuffle in, and both uncle and nephew watch them take their seats from where they’re kneeling at their own places.</p><p>Lan Qiren bangs the gong, and the meeting begins.</p><p>Almost immediately, it becomes apparent that today’s discussion is not going to go as smoothly as Jiang Cheng previously (stupidly) hoped. Instead, the sect leaders present devolve into squabbling as tensions run high and everyone begins accusing everyone else of trying to rig the new system’s set-up for their own benefit.</p><p>Suggestions – even perfectly good ones – get shot down simply because some feel that they will have to make concessions.</p><p>The head of the Qin sect, located on the eastern coast, posits a system for areas facing food shortages to receive aid from sects going through more plentiful times. Everyone else shoots the poor man down, pointing out that <em>his sect</em> will never have to make any contributions to that effort, due to its distinct lack of fertile land for farming.</p><p>(For the record, Jiang Cheng thinks it’s a pretty decent idea, actually. So does Jin Ling.)</p><p>The twenty sect leaders – the most powerful cultivators currently alive – are behaving like a bunch of petty, squabbling children. And they can’t even do anything about it. Every time they – meaning Lan Qiren, Jiang Cheng, Nie Huaisang and a few of the more sensible heads – attempt to get the discussion back on track, someone drives it off the rails again with more complaints and accusations.</p><p>It’s absolutely exhausting. It’s also what Jiang Cheng had expected going into this series of gatherings. Yesterday was a fluke, an anomaly. This is never going to work.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Jiang Cheng can see Jin Ling flagging. The boy is scowling, though he’s doing his level best to hide it, clearly frustrated by the behavior of his elders. Under the table, his fingers are digging into his bent knees and he’s shaking his leg back and forth, albeit discreetly.</p><p>Jiang Cheng can tell his nephew desperately wants to tell them all to shut up and get along, and he tries not to sigh. <em>This is the way the world really works, kid</em>.</p><p>It’s sad, how quickly the boy is being disabused of the idea that he can make a difference, even by becoming a sect leader. The ones he sees now are so fucking ineffectual.</p><p>Yes, a sect leader can do pretty much anything within the confines of their own sect, but only on their own land, and only if it doesn’t affect anyone else. Over the years, Jiang Cheng has tried to show Jin Ling that there are things he can do to make life better for the people under his jurisdiction, but this meeting is quickly becoming a crash course in the downsides of the system.</p><p>It’s almost impossible to get any sort of joint project going between any of the sects, especially something as major as this, affecting all of them.</p><p>Jin Guangyao himself, loathsome as the man was, had been a prime example of this. His viewing towers had been a good idea that actually benefitted the people of the sects – not just cultivators – but he had faced so much opposition for even the one good thing the bastard had done in his tenure as sect leader that the struggle almost hadn’t been worth it. Even now, there is talk of tearing the towers down.</p><p>Jiang Cheng sighs inaudibly and gives it up as a bad job. There’s no point listening to this garbage. It’s just giving him a headache.</p><p>As the others argue, he feels a pair of eyes on him from across the room. Even after all this time, he’s still not used to the sensation of being stared at. It’s unsettling, like icy fingers ghosting across his spine.</p><p>He turns his head slightly in the direction the gaze is coming from, and sees him. Lan Wangji.</p><p>The older man is staring at him with the same, inscrutable expression as always, but there is a frightening intensity there that Jiang Cheng has never had trained on him. It’s almost like… Jiang Cheng can’t really tell, with Hanguang-Jun, but it’s almost like the other sect leader is trying to figure him out. See past him – through him – into his interior, into the soft, squishy parts of him that wouldn’t hold up to a sword.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has spent most of his life constructing a hard exterior. An exoskeleton, if you will, that rises in sharp points and covers every inch of him, even his heart. It’s so familiar to him that he can’t take it off anymore. And now Lan Wangji is trying to see through it.</p><p>That is disconcerting, to say the least.</p><p>The Second Jade of Gusu has never made any effort to understand him before. He’s still not sure if that’s even what the other man is trying to do. Their relationship is very much stab first, talk later.</p><p>So what the <em>fuck</em> is he doing right now?</p>

          <p>So, this chapter is a little slow-going. I'm sorry for that. I'm still very much an amateur writer (and I don't have a beta-reader). This story is more or less an exercise in writing for me, and I'm trying to figure out what works and what doesn't - especially in terms of pacing - so please be patient.</p><p>Next chapter will have Jiang Cheng confronting Wei Wuxian about his prankster ways, and a little bit of a brotherly shouting match. Never fear, our favourite salty purple uncle was not threatening Lan Xichen - it was just a little bit of a miscommunication, because Jiang Cheng isn't terribly good with his words, as thirteen years of misunderstandings can attest to.</p><p>Please note the tags for this fic - it's going to be a slow burn. Very slow, if I can manage to write this the way I want to. Our main pairing isn't going to get together for a while yet; they're going to have to get to know each other first, and become friends before they can be each other's significant other. Both Jiang Cheng and Lan Xichen are very damaged individuals with massive trust issues (though mainly JC's problems have been illustrated thus far, we're going to get some LXC angst later on), and their relationship has to be pretty much rock-solid before they can even start to develop a romance.</p><p>Also, please notify me if I handle any of the issues in this story insensitively. I really hope I don't offend or hurt anyone - I apologise if I do, and will correct it immediately if that is the case.</p><p>Anyway, happy reading! :)</p>

    <p>The meeting drags on for what feels like hours, but is probably only a little over two. In that time, Hanguang-Jun only takes his eyes off Jiang Cheng for the last fifteen minutes or so. It’s a highly disturbing experience.</p><p>For the first time in a while, Jiang Cheng feels very exposed, like he’s some sort of specimen being dissected under a magnifying glass while someone sits by and takes notes. He can’t quite figure out why Lan Wangji is doing it, either.</p><p>Is it because he met with the man’s brother yesterday? Or because he accidentally got Zewu-Jun drunk? He shudders to think of what Lan Wangji might do to him when he gets ahold of <em>that </em>little piece of information. Disembowelment may not be wholly out of the equation. Jiang Cheng resolves to think of last night’s events as little as possible.</p><p>Despite the unnerving scrutiny of the world’s second-ranked cultivator, Jiang Cheng manages to follow the gist of the meeting, slow-moving though it is. They have accomplished very little by the time the gong sounds to signal the end of the gathering, most of it having been spent on petty arguments.</p><p>During the meeting, no less than three sect leaders have issued challenges for private duels to ‘defend their honour’, or some shit like that. In reality, said duels are just pissing contests where heads who feel that they – or their sects – have been slighted in some way whack each other with swords until they feel better. The fights are also totally immature and completely childish.</p><p>(Jiang Cheng very pointedly does not think about the fact that he has participated in more than his fair share over the years. He’s won most of them, too.)</p><p>There is a familiar tension in the air as the attendees file out of the pavilion. It’s the same kind that has hung between them all for years during the annual inter-sect gatherings. Everyone here hates everyone else and what each other stands for, because every face here today represents yet another shackle on each sect’s power and influence.</p><p>It’s not just for selfish reasons, either, despite the amount of time Jiang Cheng spends whining about it in his own head. Cultivators live long lives – most get to see their two-hundred-and-fiftieth birthday unless they’re very unlucky – and have memories nearly as long. That’s a lot of time to form and bear grudges. Nearly all of the people here have suffered personal losses at the hands of people from other sects, and the bitterness that sprouts from that makes it nigh-impossible to work together.</p><p>Qin Huanglun, the leader of the Qin sect whose suggestion, like so many others, was shot down earlier? He was the father of Qin Su, the late wife of the previous leader of the Lanling Jin sect. Her husband pushed her to suicide, and Qin Huanglun is still grieving his daughter’s death.</p><p>There are others, too. Jiang Cheng is the recipient of a dangerous amount of enmity himself, for obvious reasons – which makes those who hate him rather disinclined to listen to anything he says. But it’s too late to regret the things he’s done.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts as he is, Jiang Cheng only tunes back into the real world when Jin Ling asks permission to wander around Cloud Recesses. That’s code, he thinks, for allowing his nephew to visit his boyfriend. Which reminds him: he hasn’t seen the youngster around lately, which is rather strange. Before the events at the temple of Guanyin, it had seemed as though Jiang Cheng couldn’t take fifty steps without running into Wei Wuxian and his posse, which included Lan Sizhui. Now, the kid is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>It’s rather suspicious, now that he thinks about it. Is he deliberately avoiding him? Possibly, though it doesn’t seem like a particularly smart move.</p><p>Jiang Cheng knows he has a formidable reputation and a legendary temper, but is it really a good idea to hide from the parental figure of the person you’re seeing? It’ll just bring more trouble down on the boy’s head in the long run, though Jiang Cheng supposes rather bitterly that when your adoptive parents are Hanguang-Jun and the infamous Yiling Patriarch, you can get away with pretty much anything.</p><p>And it’s not like Jiang Cheng knows anything about dating etiquette, as his subconscious fucking <em>loves</em> to remind him.</p><p>Still, what could it hurt? He gives Jin Ling an absent-minded “yes” and watches as the boy practically leaves a dust trail in his wake as he disappears to god-knows-where.</p><p>Jiang Cheng knows it’s a dick thing to think, but he figures this relationship could benefit his nephew politically too. So far, it’s given him an in with the Gusu Lan sect – a powerful clan in their own right, and one of the Four Great Sects of the cultivation world – and when Jin Ling ascends to his seat in the Lanling Jin sect, he’ll need all the help he can get. Moreover, unless Lan Xichen has kids in the foreseeable future, Lan Sizhui is all set to inherit the mantle of sect leader. As alliances go, it’s not a bad one.</p><p>Now, if only that didn’t mean Jiang Cheng has to visit Cloud Recesses on a regular basis, it would be a match made in heaven.</p><p>Footsteps come up behind him, startling him out of his reverie. But before Jiang Cheng can react, there’s an arm swinging itself around his shoulders, and a boisterous laugh sounds in his ears.</p><p>“Hey, Jiang Cheng! What’s up, little brother?”</p><p>Speak of the devil, and he appears. Jiang Cheng sighs and turns around to face Wei Wuxian. As usual, the shorter man is wearing his customary red-and-black robes, standing out among the other white-clad inhabitants of Cloud Recesses. Lan Wangji follows only a short distance behind him, Bichen strapped to his side, impassive as ever.</p><p>Hanguang-Jun has been making it clear that he’s unwelcome since the moment he stepped foot in this place and frankly, it’s grating on his nerves.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has half a mind to go up to him, fist a hand in his robes and ask, at the top of his lungs, what the <em>fuck</em> all the staring just now was about. But he doesn’t. Instead, he clenches his fingers in his own robes and counts backwards from ten.</p><p>He will <em>not</em> make a scene, out here where anyone can see them. It wouldn’t be right, would reflect badly on his clan, would show everyone that the Yunmeng Jiang sect leader can’t even control his own temper.</p><p>Ah-Niang had told him when he was little that any personal disagreements had to be resolved just like that – personally. <em>Never get into a fight where other people can see you</em>, she’d said. <em>You are a sect leader, and you must behave like one</em>.</p><p>And Jiang Cheng listened to her. For years, he tracked his enemies to dark forests on night-hunts and settled their disputes with harsh blows that only the trees and unlucky forest animals bore witness to. He unearthed demonic cultivator after demonic cultivator and only let Zidian loose when they were back behind the walls and closed doors of Lotus Pier. Even insisted on holding his duels with other sect leaders in a quiet place after midnight, away from prying eyes.</p><p>Jiang Cheng did everything his mother told him to do, and it still wasn’t enough.</p><p>Because he had been seventeen and exhausted from running ten days without a rest, and all he’d wanted to do was curl up with the big brother he’d just saved from certain death, his big brother who had killed a centuries-old demon in a cave with only the help of another teenager while Jiang Cheng ran from the bastards who had put them there in the first place. His father had been disappointed and his mother enraged, and they’d fought about <em>him</em> outside in the courtyard where everyone could see and know that no matter what he did, or how hard he tried, Jiang Cheng wasn’t good enough. Was never going to be.</p><p>His mother had broken her own rules because of his inadequacy. But Jiang Cheng isn’t going to let that happen again.</p><p>So he swallows his anger and indignation, and turns to Wei Wuxian. He doesn’t want to look at Lan Wangji right now.</p><p>“Yes?”, he asks, his voice sharp, even to his own ears. Wei Wuxian doesn’t seem to notice.</p><p>“Can we talk to you for a bit?”</p><p>“Only if <em>he</em> leaves,” says Jiang Cheng, shooting a glare at Lan Wangji. The other man’s bland expression tightens for a moment, but when Wei Wuxian nods at him, he seems to get the message and disappears behind a corner.</p><p>Now the two of them are alone in a quiet corridor. The tension is nearly thick enough to cut with a knife, and the once-Twin Heroes of Yunmeng stand in front of each other, neither of them sure what to say.</p><p>“Let’s go for a walk,” Wei Wuxian suggests with all the cheerfulness he can muster. He knows that Jiang Cheng is uncomfortable with interactions in public places – has since they were young, because Yu Ziyuan had given him the same spiel about saving face for their sect. He simply chose not to listen.</p><p>Jiang Cheng nods. They walk through the hallways together, nodding at the few disciples they encounter on the way, who bow and move to the side to let them pass. Finally, they come to a set of rooms that seem to be uninhabited. Jiang Cheng recognizes them as the lecture halls where they used to sit and listen to Lan Qiren’s droning as students. To stay awake, Wei Wuxian had resorted to reading shitty romance novels under the table. Jiang Cheng had dug his nails into his palms and done his best to pay attention.</p><p>The older man closes the door behind them as they enter, and Jiang Cheng can’t help but feel a sense of foreboding. He tries to squash it, and is mostly successful.</p><p>“What did you want to talk about?”</p><p>Wei Wuxian scratches the back of his neck sheepishly.</p><p>“Actually, Lan Zhan wanted me to ask you a favour. He’s going to be really busy the whole of this week, ’cause the meetings and stuff are apparently going to be a whole lot harder to keep on track than we thought. So seeing as you’ve already gone a couple times…”</p><p>“You want me to keep visiting Zewu-Jun to give him the reports.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s tone is flat, but only because he’s making an effort to keep the irritation out of it. He raises his eyebrow, taking in Wei Wuxian’s expression – the grin he wears when he’s asking for something he knows he probably won’t get, and is plowing on ahead anyway.</p><p>“Every day?”, his brother adds hesitantly. “Please?”</p><p>Suddenly, there’s a pressure in his lungs and Jiang Cheng can barely breathe. It feels as though there’s something burning hot wrapped around him, squeezing, crushing him in its hold, and the temperature inside him rises to match. He explodes.</p><p>“You <em>do</em> know I have other things to do, don’t you? Outside of running errands for you and your <em>fucking </em>husband? Who – by the way – hasn’t spoken a civil word to me since I got here! I came to this thrice-accursed place on <em>your</em> request and left my sect on its own, despite the fact that that is where I’m supposed to be, because I happen to be the one running it!”</p><p>He’s breathing hard by the end of it, spitting the words with as much vitriol as he can infuse them with, but the crushing feeling in his chest is nowhere near lifted and though Wei Wuxian’s eyes are wide with the shock of his outburst, he’s not even halfway done.</p><p>His older brother has been back in this world for less than two years; their relationship isn’t even <em>close</em> to being fixed, and he thinks he can just ask Jiang Cheng for favours? That Jiang Cheng will just <em>leap</em> to do things for him, just like when they were kids and he spent nearly all his free time cleaning up Wei Wuxian’s messes?</p><p>He remembers a year ago, when they stood in the temple of the goddess of mercy, he reminded Wei Wuxian of the promise he’d made when they were seventeen and their family was still whole. And his brother said, “I’m sorry”, and walked away. Just like that.</p><p>It fucking hurt. It hurt so bad that Jiang Cheng almost cried when he hadn’t in years, because the one person he’d so naïvely thought would always stand with him had turned his back on him again. For real, this time. Still, he <em>accepted</em> it, because coming in second-place to his older brother is something he’s been doing ever since he was ten years old, and it’s still better than being nothing at all.</p><p>But Wei Wuxian doesn’t get to do this. He doesn’t get to tell Jiang Cheng that he’s not worth the effort, and then ask him to do things for him. For Lan Wangji, who Wei Wuxian had put first, before Jiang Cheng, and now always will. For the Gusu Lan sect he joined when he decided that Yunmeng wasn’t fucking good enough anymore.</p><p>His brother looks hurt now, like every word Jiang Cheng’s just said is a dagger scoring right across his heart. And Jiang Cheng, for all the rage he feels, nearly falters. Because he’s conditioned to respond to that look – to scoot closer protectively when Wei Wuxian is down, to turn his fists and razor-sharp tongue on the person who’s made his always-cheerful brother look like he’s about to cry. But this time…</p><p>This time, <em>he’s</em> the one putting that expression on Wei Wuxian’s face. And the words keep spilling out like boiling oil, burning and blistering everything in their path.</p><p>“You know, I thought you’d changed. That maybe you’d finally grown up a bit, stopped being so selfish.”</p><p>He laughs, and it’s a horrible, jagged sound.</p><p>“Well, I was wrong, wasn’t I? What you did last night just proves it. I did my fucking job, delivered the report like you asked me to. But it wasn’t enough. It’s always like that with you – nothing’s ever enough. You just keep pushing and <em>pushing</em>; it’s like you’re trying to see how far you can go, how far everyone else will go for you. You couldn’t draw the line at a goddamn report, could you? You had to mess with that jar, knowing I would be the one to deal with the fucking consequences!”</p><p>“It was just a prank,” Wei Wuxian protests, but Jiang Cheng cuts him off.</p><p>“It always is with you! Gods, you don’t even see how – how <em>immature</em> you are. Everyone else can go to hell, can’t they, as long as <em>Wei Wuxian</em> has a good time!”</p><p>Jiang Cheng can see the exact moment the other man snaps. Throughout his little rant, Wei Wuxian’s face has been steadily draining of all colour, the look in his eyes sharp like broken glass. But then a switch flips, and suddenly his brother is yelling too.</p><p>“I was trying to <em>help</em>, you dumbass! You’re so uptight all the time, and Lan Xichen’s just gloomy, so I figured both of you needed to lighten up a bit. But <em>gods forbid</em> I do something good, right? Everything that goes wrong is somehow my fault, never mind that I just wanted you to be happy! I don’t know why I’m even trying, if you blame me for every little thing!”</p><p>“Maybe you shouldn’t!”</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t mean to say it; he really doesn’t. It’s like the words have a mind of their own, and they fly out of his mouth as easily as he does on Sandu. But they’re barbed when they land, and he can almost see the way his thoughtless scream tears at his brother, sinking deep into his skin and ripping through any flesh it finds.</p><p>“You don’t have any room to talk,” Wei Wuxian roars. His ponytail has come nearly all the way undone, and the ends of it are shaking with the force of his rage. The same rage that raises corpses and decimates his enemies. The rage that turned him into the Yiling Patriarch.</p><p>“You stand there and talk about how I destroy everything that I touch, but you can’t judge me. You think I don’t care when I hurt people? Of course I fucking do! Everything I’ve ever done has been to help people, including you. I was willing to go my entire life by your side, as your <em>servant</em>, because I cared about you.”</p><p>“You want to talk about heartless? Well then, let’s talk about you. I may hurt people by accident – I know I have, and I regret it – but you? You’re no better. In fact, you’re even worse than I am. Because you hurt people to make yourself feel better. You’re not even a whole person, Jiang Wanyin!”</p><p>“Shut up! <em>Shut up!</em>”</p><p>Jiang Cheng can’t… he doesn’t even know what he can’t do. There’s so much. He can’t listen to this anymore, because every part of this is wrong.</p><p><em>I cared about you</em>. Past tense. <em>Cared</em>.</p><p><em>Jiang Wanyin.</em> It sounds so wrong, coming from Wei Wuxian’s mouth. It’s the first time he’s ever called Jiang Cheng by his courtesy name, instead of his given one. He’s the only person in the world who doesn’t do that. Not <em>Jiang Cheng. Jiang Wanyin.</em></p><p>But that’s not even the worst thing about this. The worst part is that Wei Wuxian is right. Everything he’s saying, even though it feels so awful it makes Jiang Cheng’s teeth and bones ache with the wrongness of it, is completely and utterly the truth.</p><p>He’s a monster. He’s <em>not even a whole person</em>. He’s killed entire families, burned buildings to the ground, tortured people simply because he wanted to. Because it fed the fire inside of him, made it burn higher, hotter, until it swallowed him whole and he couldn’t tell where the fury ended and he began.</p><p>Wei Wuxian is right. But hell will freeze over before Jiang Cheng admits it to anyone but himself.</p><p>He yells something – he doesn’t even know what – and Wei Wuxian yells something back. And now they’re hurling insults at each other, dredging up recent and old childhood hurts and grievances, like snakes spitting poison right where they know the other hurts the most, right where they know lay each other’s insecurities and wounds both scabbed over and so deep they haven’t even started to heal.</p><p>The two of them have known each other too long; they can do too much damage, because Wei Wuxian knows Jiang Cheng better than anyone and Jiang Cheng spent the better part of his childhood listening to his big brother’s secrets. And each of them wants to hurt the other as badly as they too have been hurt, so now they scratch and bite and tear at each other with the ferocity that only two people who have loved each other can bear to show.</p><p>Jiang Cheng barely registers when he pulls Sandu out. It’s mostly reflex at this point, that he draws his sword when he feels threatened. But Wei Wuxian leaps back at the sudden hiss of metal, the glint of the blade as it catches the light, and Jiang Cheng is abruptly reminded that Wei Wuxian is unarmed, that his golden core isn’t his own and is weak as hell, and so he’s basically defenseless.</p><p>This information barely has time to sink into Jiang Cheng’s brain before a hand pushes into his chest and suddenly there is someone standing between him and his adopted brother. A tall figure in white, with a sword strapped to his waist.</p><p>“Stop,” says Lan Wangji.</p><p>His expression looks blank, but his mouth is pinched together. It’s subtle, and Jiang Cheng almost doesn’t recognize it through the haze of rage and pain that mists his mind, but it’s there, and the ability to recognize tiny details like this has saved Jiang Cheng’s life more than once on the battlefield.</p><p>“Stop,” he says again, and somehow they do, without even the need for the infamous Gusu Lan silencing technique. As if both of them recognize that they have gone too far this time, inflicted too much damage that may never be repaired.</p><p>Then Hanguang-Jun grips his husband by the wrist and drags him out the door, and the two of them vanish from sight as it swings closed behind them. And Jiang Cheng is alone, with no one to watch him. No one to see anything he does.</p><p>He sinks to his knees and covers his face. No, he’s not crying. Absolutely fucking not.</p>

          <p>So here we are. The longest chapter I have written to date: 3,470 words. What a whopper.</p><p>About the chapter itself: I'm sorry if this upset any of you. Please don't kill me - JC and WWX's relationship is going to improve. After all, we're all about the happy endings here on The Beginner's Guide To Moving On. I just had to write this, because I personally don't buy that sweeping all their mutual baggage under the rug will allow them to rebuild a healthy friendship-slash-brotherhood-slash-whatever. There's too much enmity and unhappiness there, and sooner or later it would have come to a boil. And I think that getting it out of the way now will allow them to air all their issues with each other and clear the air between them for a fresh start. Speaking from personal experience, it's usually better to have a massive screaming match with your siblings than to keep all your problems bottled up. At least afterwards, you get to hug and make up and everything's mostly okay again.</p><p>I apologise if I portrayed the interactions between two brothers unrealistically. My only sibling experience is with my own sister, so it's unlikely that the sibling dynamics I'm used to will be very similar to the ones portrayed on the show.</p><p>As always, I hope you enjoyed the chapter. I really love reading your comments - I don't always reply, but I promise, I do read them all.</p><p>Note: This will be the last chapter for the next three days. I'm taking a short break to celebrate Christmas, so the next update will most likely come on Boxing Day. Merry Christmas everyone, and a Happy New Year!</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Jiang Cheng kneels on the floor for the better part of an hour. His legs begin to cramp in the first half, and go numb in the second, but he can’t bring himself to move. Inside, he feels hollow, like the bitter, angry words he and Wei Wuxian hurled at each other tore him open and bled him out, and so he holds his position on the cold stone floor until his body matches the way he feels inside.</p><p>He should be angry. He should be furious, even. He wants to – he wants to rage at Wei Wuxian for everything the other man has said, for sitting on his fucking high horse and <em>judging</em> him, finding him unworthy.</p><p>But he can’t.</p><p>He wants to summon that cold fire from where it always hides simmering in his gut, to coax it to a blaze and let it consume him, burn him from the inside out until he feels as though he could burn the world with him. He wants that old, comforting hate back, from those thirteen years when Wei Wuxian was nothing to him but a nightmare figure, the traitor that turned his back on him and destroyed his world. He wants so many things.</p><p>But Jiang Cheng can’t do any of them.</p><p>He can’t start a bonfire when he’s nothing more than a snuffed-out candle, cold and lonely, dripping wax solidifying around a charred-black wick. There’s nothing left in him. Just numbness, and an aching feeling that he’s just fucked everything up.</p><p>And for what? A stupid report? A jar of wine? A daily visit to a man whose friends turned on each other and then on him, before finally dying and leaving him to pick up the pieces?</p><p>What the fuck is wrong with him? They were doing so well, their relationship nothing like it used to be but getting there, like a gaping wound painstakingly stitched up with spidersilk, fragile and delicate. And then Jiang Cheng went and ripped it open again, leaving nothing but torn flesh and fraying threads.</p><p>Yesterday, they’d been talking politics and teasing Jin Ling together. Wei Wuxian had hugged him, and Jiang Cheng squeezed back. They were making progress.</p><p>Then Jiang Cheng started the argument, and everything went to shit.</p><p>And Jiang Cheng <em>did</em> start it. Regardless of what Wei Wuxian had done, what he’d said that made Jiang Cheng so mad he couldn’t see straight, what insults were flung back afterwards, those first ugly words had been all him.</p><p>Why did it matter anyway? Why couldn’t Jiang Cheng just suck it up, sigh and agree to his older brother’s latest request, as he did so many times in their shared childhood? Why couldn’t he just brush off Wei Wuxian’s latest dumb prank, like every other one he weathered before it?</p><p><em>Control your temper</em>, his father had emphasised time and time again. But he wasn’t able to – he lost it, just like he had when he was a stupid little boy, playing at being a man. And now he’s a man, playing at being a whole fucking person.</p><p>It always comes back to that, doesn’t it? To Jiang Cheng, and how there are pieces missing from him where there shouldn’t be. Strength. Compassion. <em>Love</em>.</p><p>He scrubs at his face frantically, and he’s surprised when his hands come away dry. His eyes feel hot, though, and swollen, his cheeks faintly sticky where the salty dampness dried ages ago.</p><p>Jiang Cheng hasn’t shed tears in years, but even such a length of time can’t erase the knowledge that he’s not a pretty crier. His face always goes blotchy, and his skin too tight. If he leaves now, everyone in Cloud Recesses will know that the leader of the Yunmeng Jiang sect has been bawling like a fucking baby.</p><p>He’s retained power, kept his sect at the top thus far only by a combination of cunning, ruthlessness and brute strength. He can’t afford to show weakness, especially not now. There’s Jin Ling to think about. Jiang Cheng can hardly help his nephew gain the others’ respect if he himself is on the verge of losing it.</p><p>So he sighs, gathers the shreds of dignity he hasn’t yet wept onto the lecture hall floor, and stands up. Or he tries to.</p><p>After kneeling for so long, he’s lost all feeling in his legs. His knees buckle the moment he puts his full weight on them, and it’s only by bracing himself against a nearby side-table that he keeps himself from crashing to the floor.</p><p>“Fuck,” he mutters as he regains his balance. His voice is so hoarse it’s almost funny. Pins and needles assault his lower half, and he sways a little as he totters on over to the small bathroom tucked away at the back of the hall, near Lan Qiren’s massive oak desk.</p><p>The water is cool against his over-heated skin. He splashes his face a few times, until the tight feeling has gone away and he’s sure his cheeks and nose are more or less one colour, rather than white overlaid with red splotches. He also rinses his mouth, because a couple tears have found their way into his mouth sometime during the last hour, and despair tastes fucking <em>nasty</em>.</p><p>When he’s finally satisfied that he can pass for a normal human being, he dries his face with a corner of his sleeve and walks out the door, leaving the empty lecture hall behind.</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>Jiang Cheng honestly doesn’t know where he’s going. Right now, all he’s doing is wandering aimlessly through the halls of Cloud Recesses, his feet taking him through turn after turn without really thinking about it.</p><p>All he’s decided is that he’s not going back to the rooms he’s been assigned.</p><p>The next meeting isn’t until tomorrow, so Jin Ling is probably out doing gods-know-what. Most likely with Lan Sizhui and <em>oh fuck no</em> Jiang Cheng really doesn’t need to think about that kid right now. There’s really a very low probability that he’ll run into his nephew if he stays in his rooms for the rest of the day, but Jiang Cheng doesn’t want to take that chance.</p><p>He’s not sure he can handle himself around Jin Ling right now. And he <em>definitely</em> doesn’t trust the kid not to go poking if he thinks something is wrong.</p><p>For all the brat’s rudeness and excessively thin skin, Jin Ling sometimes cares too much about things he has no business thinking about.</p><p>Anyway, the thought of remaining confined in a room – even a nice one – for the rest of the day makes Jiang Cheng’s chest go tight and his skin itch. He’s not claustrophobic, but right now he’s not in the mood to lie in bed and stare at the ceiling for hours on end.</p><p>He needs to be <em>outside</em>. Maybe that will soothe the hollow ache that has settled low in his stomach, and the throbbing pain currently building between his temples.</p><p>Perhaps he could hit something. Work on his technique with Sandu until his muscles burn with the exertion and he can’t think of anything else except the sword in his hand and the ‘thunk’ it makes when it connects with the target. Then a bath.</p><p>Yes, that sounds like an excellent idea.</p><p>He tunes back into his surroundings, intending to head to one of the smaller courtyards to practice his swordwork where no one will see him. Intead, he finds himself in a stretch of corridor that looks suspiciously familiar.</p><p>The white walls and open ceiling are exactly like every other hallway in Cloud Recesses, but somehow, without Jiang Cheng noticing it, the stone floor has changed to slatted wood under his feet. The passage itself is narrower, too, as befitting a place where nobody comes.</p><p>There is a garden just beyond the part where the walls branch out into open space, only metres away from where Jiang Cheng is standing. Rows and rows of bushes studded with flowers, planted neatly in straight, orderly lines. Peonies, carnations, roses, and more.</p><p>Jiang Cheng stops dead. This place <em>is</em> familiar. He’s already been here twice before. Once by accident and once last night, holding a jar of wine and thinking it was tea.</p><p><em>Damn it</em>, he thinks. An instinct tells him to turn around and run away, to get the fuck out of here before the man living here notices that there’s an intruder in his space. But it’s too late.</p><p>Because the man in question is in the garden, kneeling between a rose bush and a row of sunflowers, dark head bent over the green leaves. Before Jiang Cheng can disappear, he looks up. His eyes lock immediately onto Jiang Cheng’s face, and they seem to glow in the sunlight.</p><p>Zewu-Jun gets to his feet gracefully, as always. Long fingers brush dirt of the knees of his robes, and Jiang Cheng recognizes the clothes from the night before. The other man raises his hand in a tiny wave.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang,” he says, smiling gently. “Good afternoon.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Whatever Lan Huan expected this morning when he told his pounding head to be quiet and went outdoors to tend the garden, this wasn’t it. He’s spent most of the hours since then watering the flower bushes and pulling up weeds. There is sweat on his brow and dirt under his fingernails, and Lan Huan is wearing the same robes Sect Leader Jiang saw him in yesterday.</p><p>He is clearly in no state to receive visitors, far from the poised and elegant creature most probably expect the Gusu Lan sect leader to be. Frankly, this is embarrassing. Jiang Wanyin keeps catching him at the most inopportune times – this is what, the third occasion now?</p><p>Granted, it would help if Lan Huan ever knew he was coming, but the other man has the unfortunate habit of appearing when he is least expected. And seeing Lan Huan at his worst.</p><p>Though the sun is already directly overhead, Lan Huan is no closer to remembering the events of last night than he was when he woke up before dawn. The night he spent under the influence of whatever had been in that jar remains the same frustrating blank as before. He can’t decide whether that’s a good thing.</p><p>Still, the memory of the note left on his bedside table this morning haunts him a little. <em>Should you wish to preserve your reputation</em>. Lan Huan has the sneaking suspicion that more happened during those hours than the other man has told him.</p><p>In the present, Sandu-Shengshou is standing in the corridor outside his house, looking as though he would rather be anywhere else. But before long, the uncertainty in his face vanishes, to be replaced by the man’s famous scowl. His hands are lost somewhere in the folds of his robes, but Lan Huan imagines that they are clenched into fists.</p><p>In this moment, it is nearly impossible to reconcile this frowning, ill-tempered man with the one who fed ducks by the tiny pond out back just last week. Or the one who probably helped Lan Huan to bed last night.</p><p>It is, instead, easier to imagine such a man leaving a threatening note by the bedside of a rival sect leader.</p><p>Lan Huan abruptly thinks back to an hour ago, when Wangji came by. His little brother had been uncharacteristically agitated, and Lan Huan nearly panicked before remembering that Wangji was a fully-grown man, second highest on the list of cultivators and married to the Yiling Patriarch. (Though the latter was probably a cause for concern rather than reassurance.)</p><p>During the short visit, the other man said little, only that he would be too busy to come by for the rest of the week. He and Wei Wuxian had asked Sect Leader Jiang to visit instead to keep Lan Huan updated, but the younger sect leader would not be coming.</p><p>Wangji left after only a few minutes and remained tight-lipped throughout the entire conversation, but Lan Huan had enough practice reading his brother that he could glean information from between the lines.</p><p>Something had happened. Something big, probably between Jiang Wanyin and Wangji’s husband, and now Wangji was upset because of it.</p><p>In the present, Lan Huan studies Sect Leader Jiang as he enters the garden. He is unusually pale, and though he maintains his impeccable posture, his movements lack a certain confidence that Lan Huan has come to associate with the other man. No – not quite confidence. <em>Assertiveness</em>.</p><p>His scowl, too, despite being as fierce as ever, seems rather half-hearted in the set of its lines. Fragile, somehow, like a layer of glass placed over the top of an empty box. There is little anger in the expression; only weariness, and perhaps… defeat.</p><p>Lan Huan is many things, some of which are now obsolete. Sect leader, <strike>son</strike>, uncle, nephew, mentor, <strike>friend</strike>. But before all of that, Lan Huan is an older brother.</p><p>Before his duties included diplomatic missions to other sects, or twenty-page reports missing a last important signature, he’d soothed scraped knees and cut fingers, held Wangji in his arms as he rocked him to sleep. He’d wiped tear-soaked cheeks and slept curled around his baby brother to chase the nightmares away. Even though Wangji hasn’t needed any of those things in years, instincts like those don’t just go away.</p><p>And right now, the look on Jiang Wanyin’s face is triggering every last one of them.</p>

    <p>This is ridiculous, Lan Huan thinks. It isn’t enough that he is grossly overprotective of his blissfully married, high-powered cultivator of a younger brother, an acting sect leader in his own right. Of course, those protective instincts just <em>have</em> to extend to everyone within eyeshot who looks to be in even mild distress. Including – notably – Sect Leader Jiang: Sandu-Shengshou, one of the most feared men in the entire world.</p><p>Sometimes Lan Huan questions his own sanity.</p><p>Still, he can’t stop himself from inviting the other man inside, and offering him tea as well. Jiang Wanyin accepts cautiously, as he did last night, though he makes sure to take a sip of the steaming liquid before Lan Huan brings his own mug to his lips, casting a pointed glance at Lan Huan as he does so. As if he’s checking that there’s no alcohol in the drink offered to him.</p><p>It’s rather rude, but Lan Huan can’t find it within himself to be offended.</p><p>“So, Sect Leader Jiang, what brings you here today?” He asks politely, as though he’s simply conducting small talk, but he actually is rather curious about the answer. “My brother informed me earlier that you would no longer be coming.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin’s severe expression remains unchanged, but a hint of red rises to his cheeks. At least he has the decency to look embarrassed about dropping by unannounced. Again.</p><p>“Wei Wuxian and I… had a small disagreement this morning,” he says haltingly. Lan Huan maintains his genial smile, though he has the feeling that said disagreement was anything but small.</p><p>“Regarding…?”</p><p>“Personal matters.” The reply is grim, though delivered in a perfectly professional tone. If he didn’t know better, Lan Huan would think the other man was grinding his teeth. “However, I will honour your brother’s request regardless, if this arrangement is amenable to you.”</p><p>Lan Huan inclines his head, though something in his chest gives a little leap at the thought. A daily visitor – at least for the duration of this week. He loves Wangji’s visits, he really does, but Lan Huan has always been what many call a ‘people person’. Which his younger brother decidedly is not.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin is the only other person Lan Huan has seen in a year. He may be surly and unpersonable, but it’s a small price to pay for the promise of <em>company</em>. <em>Interaction</em>.</p><p>A tiny voice in his head tells him that if he’s miserable, it’s because he’s brought it upon himself. Lan Huan ignores it and takes a gulp of his tea instead. The hot liquid scalds his tongue, turning his mouth painfully numb. He ignores that too.</p><p>“That would be excellent, yes.”</p><p>The other man puts his mug down and gives a report of the events of the meeting. Lan Huan listens in growing dismay, coupled with a familiar sense of resignation. Yesterday’s meeting <em>had</em> been too good to be true, indeed. Now that the sect leaders have reverted to their natural state of anarchy, it will be difficult for Wangji and the others to keep them on track.</p><p>Still, he holds out hope that it is possible for change to be made. He has faith in his little brother; after all, Wangji has proven time and time again that he can do anything he sets his mind to. This is the man who waited thirteen years for the person he loved to come back from the dead.</p><p>(Sometimes Lan Huan wonders if his baby brother would do the same for him, were he in Wei Wuxian’s position.)</p><p>But he listens with a smile on his face anyway, as Jiang Wanyin describes the three separate challenges issued during the meeting, all for ridiculously trivial reasons. The disdain in the other sect leader’s voice when he details the back-and-forth sniping between the rest of the clan heads is audible, and Lan Huan struggles not to laugh when he notices that Sect Leader Jiang’s tone and inflections change slightly as he repeats each person’s words. As if, unconsciously, he’s mimicking the speakers.</p><p>He relaxes more as the conversation progresses. When it becomes clear that Lan Huan isn’t going to probe further about the aforementioned “small disagreement”, the atmosphere lightens.</p><p>Suddenly, Lan Huan realises that he’s almost comfortable with the other sect leader. The tension between them has lessened until it’s barely there – or as little as it can be, between two near-strangers who know each other only in a political capacity. And the tenuous relationship of a pair of brothers-in-law.</p><p>The realisation hits him like a bucket of freezing water drawn from the Cloud Recesses’ cold springs. A chill washes over his entire body, sending a shock through his system.</p><p>His stomach tightens. <em>Comfortable</em>. Lan Huan can’t be <em>comfortable</em>, not with anyone besides his brother. Not after what happened with Jin Guang– with <em>him</em>. He feels as though he’s sliding down a cliff wall, hands scrabbling frantically for purchase on the rough stone but unable to hang on, nothing but empty air beneath his feet.</p><p>Lan Huan can’t trust anyone except Wangji. He isn’t allowed to. He can’t allow himself to.</p><p>(He’s been on the cliff for over a year, and there are hands, so many hands, reaching out to him. But he can’t take any of them, because the moment their fingers brush, they crumble away. Sometimes he’ll reach out to grasp one, press their palms together in a prayer for salvation, but then the hand lets go, and he’s falling, falling, <em>falling</em> with no one to catch him. He knows, because this is what he sees in his dreams. His nightmares, over and over again.)</p><p>It’s a struggle to keep the soft smile on his face, and he can feel it hardening. Becoming brittle, like dried-out eggshells.</p><p>He needs to escape, to find a ledge that is solid under him before he falls again. Because the hands are still reaching out, and he can’t afford to give in to the desire to take one. Lan Huan changes the subject.</p><p>“What exactly happened last night, Sect Leader Jiang? I confess, I remember very little of the events that transpired. I did receive your note this morning, but the exact details still elude me.”</p><p>Yes, this is good. A safe topic. Lan Huan can hardly be tempted to trust a man who has threatened him, and it will do him good to remind himself of that. Not to mention, he really does need to find out what happened last night. If it has given a rival sect leader blackmail material, well, that really doesn’t bear thinking about.</p><p>Surprisingly, a flush creeps its way up Jiang Wanyin’s neck.</p><p>“Nothing untoward,” he replies, echoing the words from the note. “There was a, ah… mishap involving the roof. You climbed up, and I brought you down. Nothing more.”</p><p>Well, this is unexpected. He can see how that might be damaging to his reputation, should it happen again in the future. It’s now Lan Huan’s turn to be embarrassed.</p><p>“Nothing more?”</p><p>“You may have been asleep at the time,” the other man admits. “On the way back down, I mean.”</p><p>Instantly, every drop of blood in Lan Huan’s body is redirected to his face. He tries to suppress the blush, but the growing heat in his cheeks is telling enough of his lack of success.</p><p>“I see,” he says faintly. “Until just now, I was unaware I had behaved so… improperly. I apologise for any inconvenience that may have caused you.”</p><p>The other man lifts his tea, long since gone cold, to his mouth and downs all of it in a single swallow. The situation is obviously nearly as awkward for him as it is for Lan Huan. The thought is rather comforting, although he still wishes he’d changed the subject to literally anything else.</p><p>“There’s no need. I simply wished to give you a piece of friendly advice. To my knowledge, those from your sect do not handle alcohol well. It is not something to be ashamed of, it just <em>is</em>. That said, I do hope you watch any gifts from your brother-in-law carefully, from now on. This isn’t the first time he’s pulled something like this.”</p><p>The reference to Wei Wuxian as ‘your brother-in-law’ is jarring. It is the first time Lan Huan has heard it, and for a moment, he wonders what went on between the two of them to make Jiang Wanyin act this way.</p><p>Then his brain catches up with his heart, and he registers the meaning of the statement.</p><p>The other man hadn’t been threatening him at all, simply passing on a recommendation he thought would be helpful. Guilt snakes through Lan Huan’s insides. When did he start assuming the worst of people? His tendency to see the best in others has always been his most positive attribute. When did that change?</p><p>He re-assesses the man seated opposite him.</p><p>Even with his obvious embarrassment, Jiang Wanyin is much more at ease now than he did when he first entered the garden. Despite this, the other sect leader looks tired. His face is wan, and the melancholy look that so triggered Lan Huan’s protective instincts, though fainter now, still hasn’t gone away.</p><p>Lan Huan feels the overwhelming urge to do something ill conceived and ridiculous, like nag at him to go back to his rooms and sleep. Which would undoubtedly be a truly terrible idea. Jiang Wanyin most certainly would not appreciate being mothered, especially by another man a scant four years older than himself.</p><p>He forces the strange compulsion down with an effort.</p><p>“How were you feeling this morning?” Jiang Wanyin’s voice drags Lan Huan out of his thoughts before they can swamp him again. “I don’t mean to pry, but sometimes when one… overindulges the night before, waking up the next morning can be rather unpleasant.”</p><p>Lan Huan startles himself by chuckling. ‘Unpleasant’ was one way to describe the lancing pain and stomach-churning nausea that greeted him when he opened his eyes only hours earlier. And a particularly mild way at that.</p><p>“It was not a nice experience,” he admits ruefully. “Why is alcohol so popular, then, if it leaves the drinker feeling like that?”</p><p>The answering laugh Jiang Wanyin emits takes Lan Huan by surprise. It’s a deep, mirthful sound. Something inside Lan Huan warms when he hears it – the same something that reminds him that Sandu-Shengshou probably laughs only rarely.</p><p>“Of course you wouldn’t know,” the other man replies. Though the words are condescending, his tone is anything but. “I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but most people tend to remember their experiences while intoxicated. I know first-hand that it can be a very good feeling, at least in the moment.”</p><p>“First-hand?”</p><p>“Yes, actually. Alcohol <em>isn’t</em> prohibited in Lotus Pier, you know. That’s one thing we have over you Lans.”</p><p>Lan Huan winces, but there’s a smile behind it. “I’m not sure my headache this morning would agree with you there.”</p><p>That gets a disdainful sniff, and a haughty comment of “lightweight”. Lan Huan nearly laughs again. He’s only seen Jin Rulan a few times at various annual gatherings – and never since he decided to go into seclusion – but right at this moment, Jiang Wanyin looks exactly like his nephew whenever Lan Huan saw the child avoiding his peers. It’s such a perfectly <em>Lanling Jin </em>sect gesture to make.</p><p>Lan Huan wonders who got it from whom. Did Jin Rulan inherit it from his uncle, or was it the other way around?</p><p>But quickly, the contempt turns to concern.</p><p>“I don’t suppose you’ve ever heard of a ‘hangover remedy’, have you?”</p><p>Lan Huan shakes his head. When he was younger and on the run from the Wen soldiers, sharing a room above a brothel with a boy named Meng Yao, he’d known some of the workers there turned to liquor to dull the pain of the ‘services’ they had to provide. Often, they complained of headaches the next day, but never had Lan Huan heard of anything that could ease the effects of too much alcohol.</p><p>“Is it something medicinal? I’m not sure I could make anything like that – I grow my own herbs, but I don’t think any of the ones I have possess such properties.”</p><p>“No,” Sect Leader Jiang scoffs. “No fancy plants required. The best cure for a hangover is actually just food. The greasier the better.”</p><p>He pauses for a moment, as if reliving some memory.</p><p>“Eggs are good. Pork, too. Everything should be fried and thoroughly salted.”</p><p>Lan Huan blanches. No wonder he’s never heard of such a cure. Food in Cloud Recesses is as bland as possible, salt and spices kept to a minimum to encourage discipline among those who live there. It’s easier to regard worldly pleasures as less important if they are also less pleasurable. Before Lan Huan left Gusu for the first time, he had never even tasted anything fried.</p><p>What Jiang Wanyin is describing so casually is something that would probably give Lan Huan’s uncle a heart attack if it were ever put in front of him. It is an utter travesty by Gusu Lan sect standards, an affront to their very way of life. Lan Huan immediately wants to try it.</p><p>“Can you make it?”, he ventures cautiously.</p><p>“Sure. My broth– Wei Wuxian used to drink too much all the time. Then he’d wake up the next morning and do nothing but complain. Ah-Jie used to make breakfast for him when he got like that; sometimes when she wasn’t there I took over just to shut him up.”</p><p>Just then, Lan Huan’s stomach lets out an embarrassing growl: the result of hours spent outside on an empty stomach, on account of the nausea he felt this morning. It’s past time for lunch, and he still hasn’t eaten yet. He flushes a little, tugs at his sleeves self-consciously. That was terribly undignified, he thinks. <em>If Shu-Fu ever caught me behaving like this, he might have an aneurysm.</em></p><p>Jiang Wanyin meets his eyes. There’s a hint of laughter in those gray depths, but it’s not the mocking kind. It’s warmer somehow. Friendlier.</p><p>Suddenly, Lan Huan is on the cliff again and a hand is reaching out – a hand wearing a silver ring with a purple stone. But instead of waiting, the hand closes the distance and wraps itself around Lan Huan’s own. This time, it doesn’t let go.</p><p>“Would you like me to make you some?”</p><p>Lan Huan smiles.</p><p>“Thank you. I’d like that very much.”</p>

          <p>I'm not super happy with this chapter. LXC seems a little out of character here, but I did promise angst, so I suppose that's what we've got here. With regards to said angst, I attempted that because I figure that what JGY and NHS both did to LXC during the course of the novel would give the poor guy massive trust issues, and so he'd probably get pretty nervous when confronted with his desire to have JC as a friend. After all, all his previous friends are either dead, or tried to murder each other, or both. Not really a recipe for a healthy, happy human being. That's kind of the whole reason he's in seclusion in the first place, at least in my mind.</p><p>One of the things I love so much about the potential XiCheng dynamic (that wasn't explored in the novel, damnit) is that both of them are complete messes, but if you think about it, they'd fill each other's needs very well if they were closer. </p><p>I mean, JC has so many issues he makes Oscar the Grouch look like a cuddly teddy bear, and so he needs someone who will both put up with his temper and not let JC walk all over him/her, while providing the support and reassurance that JC so desperately needs. LXC can do that, obviously, as a strong cultivator in his own right, but also because he's famous for his even temper and good nature.</p><p>LXC's trust issues, by contrast, are a separate problem. He's only now coming to terms with the fact that the people closest to him (aka JGY and NHS) have been lying to him and manipulating him for over thirteen years. He's going to be very relationship-shy, even with his tendency to see the best in people - which, though it will still remain there, might take a rather hard blow - because he's probably terrified he'll just be used again. JC is someone who is almost completely ruled by his emotions; I'm not even sure he knows how to manipulate others. He's painfully honest, to the point of rudeness, and will tell you to your face if he hates you. With him, LXC doesn't have to worry about being lied to, because let's face it, JC probably can't lie for beans. Plus, he's super protective of the people he cares about, which LXC undoubtedly will be if they get to know each other better. JC is the kind of person who will truss you up with Zidian and slow-cook you in an oven if you mess with his family.</p><p>Anyway, rant over. Please don't be turned off by it - I get really passionate about these two. As usual, I hope you've enjoyed this chapter. If you have anything you want to scream at me about XiCheng (or anything else MDZS-related), please leave a comment :)</p><p>Note: Shu-Fu (叔父 in Simplified Chinese characters) is a term that is used in the untranslated version of MXTX's novel. 'Shu' here means 'uncle', while 'Fu' is 'father'. LWJ uses this term to address LQR in the novel, as LQR is his uncle, but also raised him like a father. Loosely translated, though, it simply means 'uncle'.</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng has made a mistake. He realises this the second the words leave his mouth.</p><p><em>Would you like me to make you some?</em>, a voice in his head mocks, simpering and annoyingly high-pitched. He’s a fucking dumbass, is what he is. Who the hell barges uninvited into another sect leader’s house in the middle of the day, tells him that he’s witnessed probably the most embarrassing thing said sect leader has ever done, and then offers to make him lunch? Jiang Cheng must be losing his mind. Not that he ever had much of one to begin with.</p><p>But surprisingly, Lan Xichen doesn’t tell him to sod off and leave him alone. Actually, it’s not surprising at all – Zewu-Jun is famous for his unending patience and ridiculously even temper – but that doesn’t mean it should be humanly possible. The man is like a fucking saint.</p><p>Instead, he gives Jiang Cheng that guileless expression, like a baby deer, or a puppy that’s been promised a belly rub. (Jiang Cheng curses himself for the image <em>that</em> creates.) Those dark gold eyes wide and gentle, a soft smile spreading across his face. As far as Jiang Cheng can tell, it’s genuine, and the thought throws him for a loop.</p><p>The last person to smile at him like that…</p><p>His sister’s face appears behind his eyes, all high cheekbones, large eyes and long lashes, the ever-present curve to her lips that made everyone around her want to match it. The ribbons she wore in her hair, how she used to braid it every morning and taught him to as well.</p><p>Jiang Cheng blinks, and the image is gone. Just a phantom of the past.</p><p>Then Zewu-Jun goes and says he’d actually <em>like Jiang Cheng to cook for him</em>, and he’s dragged back into the present because holy crap, this is a thing he’s going to do. He can’t really say no, now that he’s offered, and definitely not with the other man looking at him like <em>that</em>. He looks so fucking happy to have Jiang Cheng and his distinct lack of social skills in his kitchen, cooking up the world’s greasiest hangover food. It’s surreal.</p><p>Here’s the thing: Jiang Cheng isn’t that great a cook. His Ah-Jie may not have been a powerful cultivator or a world-renowned beauty (which is utter horseshit in his opinion – Jiang Yanli was the most gorgeous woman to ever live), but she could kick ass in the kitchen. Jiang Cheng… not so much.</p><p>He’s good enough to keep himself alive, though considering that Wei Wuxian’s survived this long without poisoning himself with the slop <em>he</em> calls food, the bar is pretty low. Advanced dishes like the soup or roasts his Ah-Jie favoured are way out of his league, but simple stuff is alright. Jiang Cheng can handle eggs and pork in someone else’s tiny kitchen, no problem. Probably.</p><p>He makes his way into the aforementioned kitchen, Zewu-Jun following behind him curiously. Jiang Cheng asks where he keeps his cookware and utensils, and the other man directs him to a set of cupboards. The stuff he needs is stacked neatly inside the small space, and he’s careful not to disturb the order when he takes it out. Everything here has its proper place, and Jiang Cheng doesn’t want to be the one to mess it up.</p><p>He’s said before that the kitchen is tiny, but knowing it and <em>feeling</em> it are two very different things. There’s just the right amount of space for one person to maneuver, but two tall, broad-shouldered adult men are too much for it to handle. From anywhere in the kitchen, there is at most a foot between Jiang Cheng and Lan Xichen at any point in time, and though the other man is trying his hardest to be unobtrusive, Jiang Cheng is acutely aware of his presence.</p><p>Zewu-Jun is standing in the far corner of the room, giving Jiang Cheng the most space possible (which really isn’t much) to work as he roots around in the shelves for eggs, salt and cooking oil. Lots of it. Disappointingly, there isn’t any pork, though he does come up with a dried sausage. It’ll have to do.</p><p>He cuts the sausage into thinner slices, sets a wok on the stove and pours in a large volume of oil, laying a few pieces of <em>lachang</em> at the bottom with his other hand when the oil begins to hiss and sizzle.</p><p>As the meat cooks further, Jiang Cheng can feel eyes following him attentively. He doesn’t turn around – no need to make this any more awkward than it already is – but Lan Xichen’s gaze reminds him of his own as a child, perched on the kitchen counter to watch his sister cook.</p><p>His mother used to scold him for wasting time away from practicing sword drills, but Ah-Jie let him taste-test once the dish was halfway done and was always happy to have him there, even though she often had to reach across him for the knives and he sometimes sat on the recipe book by accident. The memory makes him smile.</p><p>“Why are you frying the sausage? Can’t it be eaten outright?”</p><p>The question, though sudden, doesn’t surprise him. Zewu-Jun has fixed that laser-like focus on the pan on the stove and the cooking oil burbling merrily in it.</p><p>“It’s something my sister taught me: frying the <em>lachang</em> in oil makes it richer than it would be we’d left it as it is, even though it’s cured already. Yes, it’s unhealthy, but the greasier the better, remember? Just don’t eat this every day.”</p><p>He finishes and flips the sausage slices over so they can begin cooking on the other side. Then Jiang Cheng’s brain catches up to his mouth and his face flames as he realises how he sounds. Oh gods, he’s speaking to Zewu-Jun the same way he used to explain things to Jin Ling when the boy was younger and asked questions incessantly. He’s using the same tone on Sect Leader Lan that he used to use on his four-year-old nephew when he asked why the sky was blue.</p><p>Luckily, the other man doesn’t seem to take offense. It’s a nice change – Jiang Cheng is used to rubbing people the wrong way every time he opens his mouth, whether he means to or not. The perks of hanging out with a Lan, he supposes.</p><p>Then reconsiders when he recalls Hanguang-Jun’s ice-cold glares, and the perpetual disapproving twist to Lan Qiren’s mouth. Perhaps it’s just <em>this</em> Lan.</p><p>The cultivator in question gives an answering hum and nods.</p><p>“Thank you for the instruction,” he says formally, and Jiang Cheng ducks his head to the side to conceal a smirk. The <em>lachang</em> is done now, crispy and brown on both sides. He uses a pair of chopsticks to pick the round slices out of the pan, setting them on a clean plate beside the stove. With his other hand, he cracks an egg and lets it drip onto the pan, the runny white mixing with the leftover oil and solidifying almost immediately.</p><p>Another three eggs are done in the same way while he continues explaining.</p><p>“If you do it like this, you don’t need to use a different wok when you’re done with the sausage, see? Some of the fat stays in the oil and you can use it to flavour the eggs.”</p><p>Lan Xichen listens intently, head tilted to the side as he tries to see around Jiang Cheng to what’s going on in the pan. This sort of thing is obviously very new to him, Jiang Cheng thinks with a grimace, remembering the flavourless food he and the other disciples used to eat when they studied at Cloud Recesses all those years ago.</p><p>Yunmeng cuisine is far superior, in his humble opinion. At least it tastes like <em>something</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng steps back to survey his handiwork. Not too bad, he thinks. There haven’t been any serious catastrophes, apart from a minor incident when the oil got a little too hot and spattered all over the pan. He’s also avoided making a total fool of himself in front of Zewu-Jun, which is a win in his book.</p><p>“How did you do that?”, the other man asks. There’s something like amazement in his tone. “I tried making a stir-fry once; almost set the whole kitchen on fire. Meng Yao wouldn’t let me anywhere <em>near</em> the stove after that. Even now, the best I can do is steam fish and vegetables,” he finishes sadly.</p><p>Jiang Cheng represses a snort. That means Lan Xichen can cook about three-quarters of the traditional Gusu diet. He says as much out loud, and is rewarded with a quiet laugh.</p><p>“I appreciate the compliment.”</p><p>“Oh, that wasn’t a compliment.”</p><p>They take the plates out to the living room. There’s a small table in the middle of it that doubles as a dining table, and they set the food down there. By now, the whole cottage smells of fried meat, and Jiang Cheng is abruptly reminded that he didn’t have time to eat anything this morning. But he offered to make food for the other man, not have lunch with him, so he minds his manners and keeps his mouth shut.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Lan Xichen seems to notice. His fingers, long and nimble from years of playing both the <em>guqin</em> and the <em>xiao</em>, tug at the hems of his sleeves.</p><p>“Would you stay and eat with me? I’m not sure I can finish all this myself,” he says softly. Jiang Cheng knows that’s a lie. He’s seen the other Lan sect members at mealtimes. “I don’t mean to presume on your time – you probably have other things to do – but if it’s not too much trouble?”</p><p>All of a sudden, he’s at a loss for words. Jiang Cheng hasn’t been invited to do anything in <em>years</em>. Most of his friends were lost to him when the dogs from the Qishan Wen clan attacked Lotus Pier, but even before that, he’d never been particularly close to anyone who wasn’t his immediate family.</p><p>As a child, his temper and status as the sole heir of the Yunmeng Jiang sect had dissuaded the other kids from befriending him. His only companions had been his three dogs, until his father brought Wei Wuxian home and made him chase them away. After that, his adopted brother was the closest thing Jiang Cheng had to a best friend, even though he wasn’t, technically speaking. Even when they were teenagers studying together in Cloud Recesses, Nie Huaisang – the third member of their little trio – was more Wei Wuxian’s friend than Jiang Cheng’s.</p><p>He can’t remember the last time someone asked him to do something that wasn’t a favour.</p><p>The feeling Lan Xichen’s request sparks in him is strange. But it’s a good kind of strange, like his first successful flight on Sandu, age fourteen.</p><p>“Of course it’s not. I’ve been looking for an excuse to avoid all the paperwork from Yunmeng, anyway.”</p><p><em>Really?</em> Jiang Cheng winces at himself. He’d been aiming for casual and flippant; hopefully that didn’t come off as desperate. Meanwhile, Lan Xichen sinks gracefully to his knees and picks up a pair of chopsticks. Jiang Cheng follows suit, though he’s aware that his motions lack the other man’s fluidity.</p><p>“I know how that feels. It just piles up, doesn’t it? Sometimes I feel as though I’m signing my life away every time I have to put my name down on another report. Even though I have so much time on my hands now, most of it gets taken up by all the forms sent my way.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng frowns. “I’d thought…”</p><p>He trails off, unable (unwilling) to complete the sentence. It sounds rude, even to his ears, but Lan Xichen just smiles kindly.</p><p>“You thought being in seclusion meant not doing anything, correct? It’s alright, most people make that assumption. Though it’s not fully true.”</p><p>“Fully?”</p><p>“Well, yes, there are a great many duties a sect leader cannot fulfil while in seclusion, as you would know. Diplomatic visits to other sects, for example. Clan gatherings.”</p><p>The First Jade of the Gusu Lan sect picks up a piece of sausage and takes a small bite. A grin breaks out on his face, and he makes an appreciative noise. Then he continues, his expression returning to its usual genial placidity.</p><p>“But there are other things I can do in here. I handle all – or at least most – of the paperwork involved in running our sect; Shu-Fu and Wangji cooperate to manage the rest. Public relations and the like.”</p><p>At the mention of Hanguang-Jun, Jiang Cheng can’t suppress the tiny frown that appears between his eyebrows.</p><p>“Do you miss it at all? Your other duties, I mean. Paperwork is one thing, but for me, the best part of being a sect leader is the physical bit. Getting to talk to the village representatives, meeting the other clan heads for negotiations. It’s the only part of the job that makes me feel like I’m <em>doing</em> something.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng forces himself to stop talking when he sees the other man go still, his chopsticks freezing halfway to his mouth.</p><p>Fuck, he’s stepped in it this time. Why does he keep putting his foot in his mouth around Lan Xichen? What is it about Zewu-Jun that makes him say stupid shit he’s not supposed to?</p><p>It’s an unwritten rule not to question another cultivator’s decision to seclude themself, no matter how long the period of isolation. When Qingheng-Jun, Lan Xichen’s father, resolved to sequester himself away from the outside world for the rest of his life, it had set some tongues wagging. But no one ever dared to talk about it outright.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he says, feeling like a total dick for the implied accusation he’s just shot at a man who’s been nothing but nice to him from the time he first came crashing into his home. “I overstepped, and I apologise.”</p><p>It looks like it takes an effort for Zewu-Jun to open his mouth, and the words that come out sound painful. But his smile never wavers.</p><p>“There’s no need. You’re right, I do miss it. In many ways, managing the sect hands-on was better, both for Gusu, and for myself.”</p><p>“Then why don’t you?”</p><p>“Because I have reasons, Sect Leader Jiang.”</p><p>Suddenly, Lan Xichen looks very tired, and much older than his thirty-eight years. His smile no longer gentle and cheerful, but sorrowful, melancholic. <em>Defeated</em>.</p><p>“I have my reasons, and they are selfish ones, but mine nonetheless. And as much as I regret it, I can’t leave this cottage and rejoin the rest of the world. I just can’t.”</p>

          <p>Here we are, folks. Another chapter. What even is this one?</p><p>Anyway, so about the cooking thing, I headcanon that when the Yunmeng siblings were growing up and Jiang Yanli spent a lot of time in the kitchen, Wei Wuxian was that kid that generally stayed away from chores if he could help it and thought cooking was boring but would periodically run into the room and sneak bites of the food (me, honestly). Jiang Cheng, however, liked to watch his sister and picked up some stuff from her. Not a lot, mind you - he has like zero natural talent, but enough to be able to cook basic things like rice, vegetables, and of course, he spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to cook Jiang Yanli's famous lotus root and pork rib soup, to varying degrees of success each time. He now makes it for Jin Ling's birthday every year, and when his nephew is sad and needs some discreet cheering up.</p><p>Next chapter, Lan Huan's going to open up a bit about his issues, and the reasons he went into seclusion. Jiang Cheng attempts to cheer him up. Key word: 'attempts'. We'll see how that goes. </p><p>I'm sorry if LXC's confession thing is a little abrupt - he's only been talking to JC for about what, three days now? - but it seemed like the right time when I was writing this. There are a couple reasons why I'm having him do it now, some of which I'll go into in the next chapter (I think), and it's also because this story is eighty-four pages on Word and still moving really freaking slowly. Yeah, I have pacing issues.</p><p>As always, hope you enjoyed the chapter!</p>

    <p>“I just can’t,” Lan Huan says. An aching weariness has settled in his bones, the kind he usually feels after a long night-hunt, or a skirmish back in the days of the Sunshot Campaign.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin remains silent, uncertain of what to say. What can anyone say to something like that that isn’t a curse or an accusation? Lan Huan has heard it all before. Oh, no one dares to talk about it to his face – that would be gross misconduct and a massive breach of propriety – but there are plenty of places where people are loose with their tongues, where the young son of a disgraced sect leader can overhear things he’d never wanted to about his father.</p><p>He knows what people think of clan heads that go into seclusion. <em>Unreliable. Selfish. Weak.</em></p><p>At sixteen, he stood in a marketplace and listened as two cultivators cursed his father for abandoning their sect. They called him a coward, and Lan Huan hated himself because deep in his heart of hearts, he had agreed with them. He doesn’t know what that makes him now.</p><p>The quiet in the room stretches long, like a bowstring pulled tight until it is on the verge of snapping. Lan Huan can barely even hear the other man’s breaths. But it does not feel like he is alone. The air is too thick for that, heavy with a sense of what feels like expectancy. Both of them waiting for something to give, for the other to speak.</p><p>By right, if this strange silence were a contest, Lan Huan should win. His family is known for their tight-lipped self-control, every member a master of their body that gives nothing away unless they will it. Sect Leader Jiang is not like him. Sandu-Shengshou is a man ruled by his emotions. He should be the one to lose.</p><p>But it is Lan Huan who breaks first.</p><p>“The first time I met Chifeng-Zun, I was nine years old. It was at one of the annual sect gatherings; Shu-Fu had brought me along for the first time because he thought I was old enough to learn something from it. Wangji was still too young, so he stayed home.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin is twisting his ring around his finger – a gesture, Lan Huan has noticed, that he repeats when he’s uncomfortable. He looks Lan Huan in the eye, unblinking, a stern set to his mouth. There is no pity there. For that, Lan Huan is grateful.</p><p>“Nie Mingjue was only twelve, but he was already so much bigger than I was. Nearly as tall as some of the adults. And his cultivation was so strong. He walked around Bujing-Shi with his <em>dao</em> strapped to his waist; you can imagine how impressive it looked to a nine-year-old.”</p><p>His lips twitch upwards almost imperceptibly at the memory of his Nie-Dage as a scowling preteen, shoulders thrust back and spine straight as a rod in order to seem as imposing as possible. Back then, his impression of the other boy had been coloured by hero-worship, for only through the lens of someone much younger could such a child be considered imperious and awe-inspiring.</p><p>The man across the table says nothing, only leans closer. His storm-cloud eyes have softened somewhat, but even with all his practice reading his brother’s expressions, Lan Huan can’t determine the emotion in them.</p><p>“The afternoon of that first day, some of the older disciples from the other sects – three or four of them a bit older than I was – pushed Huaisang around a little. He was very young, just turned five, and smaller than most other children his age.”</p><p>“When his brother heard, he was furious. The adults had cautioned us all to behave, but Mingjue didn’t care. He thrashed those boys all by himself, even though he knew that he was the heir of the host sect and had to give his best performance. Was punished for it, too. He was whipped so badly he couldn’t sit down for the rest of the week. Huaisang didn’t even know what was going on; he wanted his brother to hold him and cried when Mingjue scolded him for it.”</p><p>Lan Huan looks down at the food, long since gone cold. Where is he going with this? He’s just rambling, pulling up memories from years ago and seeing how time has faded them. There’s no point to all of this, no purpose his words have to fulfill.</p><p>Surprisingly, Sect Leader Jiang has something to say.</p><p>“I remember when we were all studying in Cloud Recesses, Nie Huaisang was the worst slacker of all of us. He hated the lectures with a passion, but he still studied anyway. He was always complaining about how his older brother would break his legs if he failed a test.”</p><p>There’s a ghost of a smile on his lips, but the laugh the memory gets from Lan Huan is jerky and painful, as though it’s been torn out of him.</p><p>In his dreams, sometimes, he can see a young Huaisang, trailing after his big brother. Mingjue, who slapped Huaisang’s chubby, grabbing hands away from his robes but stole fruit to give to him when the younger boy was sick. And other times, he sees himself, too – a younger version sparring with his Nie-Dage, teaching Huaisang how to do handstands.</p><p>Once or twice, he’s dreamed of more recent events. Himself giving advice, Huaisang thanking him with a hug and calling him “Xichen-Ge”. Those are the worst, because he wakes with the urge to squeeze back, expecting to see a pair of large, dark eyes set in a face mostly hidden by a fan. Then he remembers, and it leaves him hollow.</p><p>The boy he saw as a little brother never really needed his counsel anyway, and every time he pretended to was only a step in his plan to avenge his <em>real</em> older brother. Just a means to an end.</p><p>For thirteen years, Lan Huan has been <em>just a means to an end</em>.</p><p>Out loud, he says, “I’ve known Huaisang since he was five years old.” He laughs again, and it sounds like a sob. “I called him <em>Didi</em>. He came to me for advice for over two decades, asked me about girls and how to run a sect, and I told him because he was my brother.”</p><p>Something flashes across Jiang Wanyin’s face, but it’s gone before Lan Huan can identify it. Not harshness, exactly, nor vulnerability. His expression suddenly looks… strangely open, his emotions not stripped and laid bare for the world to see, but rather as if the other man has just unlocked a door, and allowed Lan Huan to see inside.</p><p>He understands, Lan Huan realises.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin understands, because he knows how it feels to have a brother turn on him, to put him last and use him as a stepping-stone to achieve a goal. That he now knows it was a misunderstanding doesn’t change the fact that for thirteen years, he believed it the total and absolute truth.</p><p>“If I can’t trust that, what <em>can</em> I trust?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p>The words ring in Jiang Cheng’s ears, even after Lan Xichen lapses back into silence.</p><p>
  <em>What can I trust?</em>
</p><p>Isn’t that how he felt for so long after his Ah-Jie had died? When he believed Wei Wuxian had betrayed him and destroyed everything they’d ever loved?</p><p>There are no words for the feeling of being forsaken by a brother. It’s like being stabbed in the abdomen, but at the same time there’s a noose around your neck and the floor has just dropped out from under you, and the only purchase your feet can find is a bed of glowing coals. So you feel your soles blister and burn while you choke on your screams instead of on the rope, and all the while the only thing you can think about is <em>why did he let me fall?</em></p><p>But there is no anger on Zewu-Jun’s face. Not even a hint of accusation. Only a terrible, all-consuming sadness and a pain that is etched into his very bones.</p><p>Lan Xichen has been betrayed by a brother – not once, but twice. He has been lied to and manipulated by two people who were supposed to care about him, but who only wanted to destroy each other. And he doesn’t even hate them.</p><p>Jiang Cheng can hear it in his tone. The way he says Nie Huaisang’s name.</p><p>He doesn’t deserve it, Jiang Cheng thinks. A sudden black rage fills him at the thought of his one-time schoolmate. Nie Huaisang has <em>shattered</em> this man, this kind soul who only wanted to help. He took his love and defiled it, used it as a sword when it was meant to be a shield, and in the process, ran his brother through with it.</p><p>(<em>Just like you</em>.)</p><p>(<em>Shut up</em>.)</p><p>“It’s not your fault,” says Jiang Cheng. The words surprise him, and from the way the other man jerks at the sound of his voice, they startle Zewu-Jun too. But he means them.</p><p>“It’s not your fault,” he repeats. Lan Xichen’s eyes are wide, dark and hurting, and Jiang Cheng <em>needs</em> him to understand, because he can see now that the other sect leader blames himself. “Nothing you did caused this. Nie Huaisang made the decision on his own, and it was his fuck-up, not yours.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng knows he’s being inexcusably rude by swearing in front of another clan head, but he can’t stop himself, and he doesn’t think he wants to. It’s not like he hasn’t broken enough Lan sect rules already. And disobeying one more stupid restriction isn’t important; this is.</p><p>The man seated across from him is horribly broken, has had it done to him by people he loved – and for some reason, still loves – and he thinks it’s <em>his fucking fault</em>. It’s not, and Jiang Cheng needs him to know that; he needs it like he needs water and air and Sandu strapped tight to his waist.</p><p>“This is life and it’s shit, but you don’t deserve it. You never have, so don’t think for a second that you’re somehow to blame for what’s happened to you. You’re a good man, Lan Xichen.”</p><p>His breathing is harsh and loud in the small room. There’s an anxious little part of him that’s deathly afraid he’s said the wrong thing, but a larger part has long since said <em>fuck it</em>, and the rest is totally on board with that. And Zewu-Jun…</p><p>Zewu-Jun is staring at him like Jiang Cheng has just professed his undying love while standing bare-ass naked in a freezing lake in the middle of winter. His mouth is hanging open, and the topic of conversation has long since stolen the gentle smile from his face, but there’s something in his expression that looks like– hope?</p><p>But now those liquid gold eyes look even more watery than normal, the lids are shuttering over them madly and <em>oh gods </em>those are actual fucking tears he’s blinking back. Damn it to hell; Jiang Cheng’s just made Sect Leader Lan cry. His brain is screaming at him to ‘<em>ABORT MISSION</em>’, but the damage is already done, and he feels like a massive douchebag.</p><p>It’s the least he can do to turn away when Lan Xichen lifts one hand up to cover his face, wiping his eyes discreetly with a corner of his sleeve. Jiang Cheng pretends not to hear the hitch in his breath, or the tiny little sniff he lets out before the hand is lowered again.</p><p>Then Jiang Cheng hears a “thank you,” so soft it’s nearly a whisper, and he thinks he’s imagined it for a second until Lan Xichen looks up again.</p><p>The corners of his eyes are red, but the other man <em>beams</em> at him and it’s like standing in sunlight on a summer day, so fucking bright that he can’t look away. Unlike the sun, though, it doesn’t hurt to look at him.</p><p>When the moment ends, it’s by silent agreement that both of them pick up their chopsticks and resume eating. The food has cooled, but it still tastes pretty decent and for a while, the only sounds are the occasional ‘clink’ of wooden chopsticks as they knock together.</p><p>To an observer, it might seem as though nothing has happened. That the two sect leaders are exactly where they were fifteen minutes – and yet an eternity – ago, sitting at a table and sharing a meal. A pair of strangers, playing at being friends. But now, everything has changed.</p><p>Now, they might actually be friends.</p>

          <p>Hey there everybody! Today's chapter was actually pretty short, but boy, was it difficult to get out. Dialogue (like most other things, but that especially) is really hard for me to write, and the conversation between JC and LXC was pretty draining. I hope you guys like it though.</p><p>In case it was unclear, what LXC was trying to say was that one of the major reasons he went into seclusion was because NHS had violated his trust, and he doesn't feel like he can trust anyone anymore, so he just sort of shut down and hid where no one could see him and use him again. (JGY did the same thing as NHS, but that's infinitely worse and it's still too painful for LXC to talk about. We'll leave that can of worms closed for the moment.)</p><p>To be honest, I adore NHS as both a character and a person - he's so smart and dedicated to his older brother; he's just trying to carve out a place for himself as the head of a sect that's not built for people like him, and he's doing amazing at it. That said, what he did to LXC was *not okay*. He kept LXC in the dark about what had happened to NMJ for thirteen years, and then manipulated him into killing JGY, the only sworn brother he had left. All LXC wanted was for his best friends to get along - he was completely innocent in all of this. Much as I love NHS, and was proud that he managed to avenge NMJ's death, that was not a good thing to do.</p><p>Okay, daily rant over.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who's hung in there for the angst rollercoaster that was the past couple chapters. The next section will be fluffier (I think). JC and LXC are going to meet up again and swap stories about babysitting their nephews, and JC is going to get some advice on handling his older brother. Hope everybody enjoyed the chapter, and see y'all again next time! :)</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng is surprised when the sun goes down and he can no longer see Lan Xichen’s face clearly in the dark. The light’s been fading slowly for hours now, and both of them barely noticed until it finally disappeared all the way and they suddenly needed candles to see more than the outlines of furniture.</p><p>Since Jiang Cheng spectacularly put his foot in his mouth – which ended quite well, actually, though he hopes not to make a habit of it – they’ve long since finished lunch. The dishes have been washed, dried, and put away neatly in the cupboards (Jiang Cheng’s noticed that Lan Xichen has a <em>thing</em> about stuff being neat and orderly, like almost everyone else in Cloud Recesses, with the exception of perhaps Lan Jingyi).</p><p>The two sect leaders have been talking since then, about everything and nothing. It’s been hours, and it reminds Jiang Cheng of the afternoon they spent together last week, feeding the ducks by the pond until the moon rose. Something is different now, though. The silences shorter between topics, the stories they share more personal.</p><p>Before, they had talked mostly about other people. Jiang Cheng had spoken about politics, about the world outside the cottage that Lan Xichen wasn’t privy to. In turn, the other man had told him about the things Wangji spoke of when he came to visit: recent night hunts, the ridiculous pranks his husband pulled, the juniors’ latest misadventures.</p><p>Today, seated in the living room of a cottage most people don’t know exists, Jiang Cheng learns that Zewu-Jun is hopeless at all but the most basic of household chores, that he hated <em>jielan</em> as a child but loves it now, and that last night was the first time he’s ever touched so much as a drop of alcohol in his life.</p><p>Lan Xichen learns things about him, too. Like how Jiang Cheng throws things when he’s angry – but always little knick-knacks that are easy to clean up, which is why his office is full of them – and how he once walked the entire length of the wall surrounding Cloud Recesses shirtless on a dare when Lan Qiren was away (Jin Ling would love to hear that story, but Jiang Cheng threatens Lan Xichen with death and dismemberment if it ever makes its way to his nephew’s tender ears). They swap childhood disasters and stupid stories about their siblings, and Jiang Cheng unwittingly ends up with quite a bit of decent blackmail material on Lan Wangji.</p><p>(Apparently, Hanguang-Jun liked to suck on his toes as a toddler. Who knew?)</p><p>There are things they don’t talk about, of course. Lan Xichen shies away from any mention of his sworn brothers. Jiang Cheng steadfastly doesn’t acknowledge his time as a hostage in Qishan, and the way his father sometimes pretended he didn’t exist.</p><p>But other than that, it’s good. Jiang Cheng can’t remember the last time he just sat and talked with another person like this, for no reason at all other than because both of them wanted to. It feels fucking fantastic. But he can’t say that, obviously; his reputation as a prickly bastard doesn’t maintain itself.</p><p>By the time he leaves the cottage, the stars are already out, the lights of Caiyi village shining in the distance. Lan Xichen walks him to the edge of the garden like the perfect gentleman he is, and when Jiang Cheng grumbles about not being a teenage girl on a date, the other man just gives a low little laugh and waves goodbye.</p><p>Jiang Cheng must be going soft in his old age, because his chest is warm like he’s just downed a whole glass of <em>baijiu</em>. He will, of course, deny this vehemently if asked.</p><p>He makes his way back to his rooms and closes the door behind him. First order of business: a bath. He hasn’t washed his hair in two days, which should be alright since he’s in Gusu, where it’s slightly colder, but Jiang Cheng likes feeling clean. If it’s a hangup from his days on the road during the Sunshot Campaign when water was scarce and no one bathed more than once a week, then it’s one he hasn’t examined too closely.</p><p>The water is hot and soothing against his skin. He lets out a contented sigh. Dips his head under the surface, and spends the next ten minutes working the tangles out of his wet hair.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jiang Cheng is just shrugging on a clean set of robes when the door flies open. A gold blur dashes into the room and skids to a halt.</p><p>“Where have you been?”, Jin Ling asks. He fixes his uncle with an indignant look. “I’ve been searching all over for you!”</p><p>In as calm a voice as Jiang Cheng can muster, he replies. “I’ve been in here.” He glares at Jin Ling pointedly. “Taking a bath.”</p><p>“But I <em>looked </em>in your rooms just now, and they were empty!”</p><p>“Perhaps you shouldn’t have looked, then. Really, Jin Ling, I thought I taught you to knock when entering someone else’s room.”</p><p>Jin Ling’s gaze drops to the floor. “Sorry, Uncle.”</p><p>But any hope that Jiang Cheng has of his nephew being suitably chastened goes out the window when Jin Ling raises his head and meets his eyes again.</p><p>“So where were you?”</p><p>“None of your business,” he answers curtly.</p><p>“<em>Uncle.</em>”</p><p>He relents. <em>Damn it</em>. “I was visiting Zewu-Jun,” Jiang Cheng says nonchalantly. Or what he hopes passes for it; he’s always been a shit actor.</p><p>Jin Ling’s eyebrow goes up in an arch that looks too familiar for Jiang Cheng to be entirely comfortable with. He gives him a suspicious look.</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Against his will, Jiang Cheng feels his own eyebrow rising. “You see what, exactly, you little brat?” Jin Ling doesn’t respond. “What did you want with me, anyway?”</p><p>He swears the boy smirks a little at his defensive tone. <em>Watch it, kid.</em> Even if the threat of broken legs no longer holds much weight, Jiang Cheng has too many embarrassing stories of Jin Ling as a baby, all the way through to his teens. His nephew will live to regret this.</p><p>“I, uh, Sizhui wants to talk to you.”</p><p><em>Ah, so we’re on a first-name basis now, are we?</em> Jiang Cheng narrows his eyes. “So why, pray tell, is it not <em>Lan</em> Sizhui barging into my rooms at this precise moment?”</p><p>He emphasises the other boy’s surname and Jin Ling flushes. He stumbles over his next words, face a bright pink. It’s a lovely contrast with the gold robes.</p><p>“We–we came here to find you at first, but you weren’t in, and then we looked all over the place and still couldn’t find you, so I suggested we split up. Sizhui went to talk to Wei Wuxian. He thought <em>he</em> might know where you were.”</p><p>“Why would–” Jiang Cheng cuts himself off before he can speak the words on the tip of his tongue. If Jin Ling let his boyfriend talk to Wei Wuxian, he must not know about the argument. And if that’s the case, then Jiang Cheng would certainly rather it stay that way.</p><p>At his nephew’s quizzical look, he mutters, “never mind”.</p><p>“So, what did Lan Sizhui want to talk to me about?”</p><p>“I, er, don’t actually know. He just said it was really important and that he had to speak with you. Something about needing to do it before Wei Wuxian pissed you off too badly.”</p><p><em>Too late</em>, Jiang Cheng thinks, his heart giving a little lurch. Then he preoccupies himself with wondering whether those were the Lan disciple’s actual words. Probably not, but he hopes so, if only for the sake of being contrary.</p><p>He stands up from where he’s sitting on the bed in one fluid movement, and levels Jin Ling with his best stare – the one that implies a heavy-duty eyeroll without him actually moving his eyes. It’s a very handy trick.</p><p>“Let’s go then,” he says impatiently. “We don’t have all day, and I have paperwork to fill out when we get back.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng grabs Sandu from his bedside table and buckles it on, much as he did when Jin Ling rousted him from slumber this morning. The sword is a comforting weight against his thigh.</p><p>“You don’t need–”</p><p>“Yes I do,” Jiang Cheng interrupts in a tone that brooks no argument. Eyeing him apprehensively, Jin Ling slips out the door and waits for him to follow. When Jiang Cheng turns the key in the lock, they set off.</p><p>They end up in the lecture hall that Wei Wuxian led Jiang Cheng to this morning, the very same place where the two brothers fought and ripped each other apart. Lan Sizhui is standing in the centre of it, face turned down, obviously deep in thought. It’s obvious who picked this meeting place, and Jiang Cheng enourages the urge to give another epic eyeroll to drown out the way his stomach drops at the familiarity.</p><p>Lan Sizhui looks up when they enter the room, and for a moment, a look of utter apprehension flits across his face before being subsumed under a blank mask just like his father’s. The son’s is decidedly less skilled, however; Jiang Cheng can see the tremble in his fingers and the quiver of his lips, subtle though it is. He looks terrified, poor kid. Doesn’t mean Jiang Cheng’s going to go easy on him.</p><p>When the two boys’ eyes meet, it’s like a moment right out of one of those damn romance novels Wei Wuxian used to make him read so he’d have someone to angst about the plot and characters to. A gooey expression takes over Jin Ling’s face, and Jiang Cheng is about seventy-five percent sure a pink fluffy unicorn is about to ‘poof’ into existence and start shitting rainbows. He watches Lan Sizhui more closely, though, and is gratified when the other boy breaks out into an equally idiotic grin.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s nephew really is stupid-in-love, but at least his boyfriend is right there with him.</p><p>Jin Ling flashes Lan Sizhui a look that Jiang Cheng recognizes as ‘<em>good luck’</em>, and with a murmured ‘bye’, darts out of the room. Leaving the two of them alone.</p><p>There is utter silence in the hall; Lan Sizhui sounds like he’s barely breathing, or at least, breathing so softly that it’s inaudible. Neither of them says a word.</p><p>Jiang Cheng takes the opportunity to look the boy up and down. Lan Sizhui is the same height as Jin Ling, nearly as tall as Jiang Cheng himself. He has none of his adoptive parents’ features, his nose slightly longer than Lan Wangji’s, his eyes grey instead of Wei Wuxian’s brown. Still pretty enough to be a Lan, Jiang Cheng thinks sardonically. He knows the kid’s a decent fighter – and he <em>is</em> still a kid, even though he now wears his hair down in the style of Gusu’s adult male cultivators rather than a child’s ponytail. His face is narrow and fair, and he’s curved his mouth into a gentle smile that reminds Jiang Cheng of… someone else.</p><p>Jiang Cheng redirects his thoughts to the person in front of him, whose smile has been getting more strained by the second.</p><p>So this is the boy who’s corrupting his nephew.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang,” says Lan Sizhui, breaking the silence. He dips low into a formal bow, every mannerism full of grace and poise. A Lan through and through. “Good evening.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng nods back at him wordlessly.</p><p><em>Be intimidating</em>, he tells himself. <em>But not an asshole</em>. He’s still the leader of the Yunmeng Jiang sect, and the kid in front of him is probably going to be the Gusu Lan clan head someday. He can’t afford to sour relations between their sects just because he wants to scare Jin Ling’s boyfriend a little.</p><p>“I apologise for taking up your time, but I needed to speak to you regarding Jin Ling.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng crosses his arms in front of his chest. Ah, so that’s what this is for. He’d thought so. Well, he’s a master of interrogation techniques, and this is the perfect opportunity for that one-on-one conversation he’d been considering last week. Lan Sizhui is going to <em>talk</em> to him, is he? He’d fucking better.</p><p>He crooks his index finger so that Zidian catches the light, glinting dangerously, and allows a few violet sparks to leap from it. Lan Sizhui’s genial expression thins, and Jiang Cheng watches his throat convulse as he swallows.</p><p>Rude, he will not allow himself to be. But that is no reason not to put the fear of every god in the heavens into the boy trying to <em>date his kid</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng grins, and his lips curl back over his teeth in a way he’s very aware can be described as wolfish.</p><p>“Speak away.”</p>

          <p>Welcome back to another chapter! It's the twentieth today, a (rather large) milestone, I think.</p><p>Just to clarify, LSZ isn't normally this jittery - he's usually very composed and Lan-like - but JC has him on edge because he's got a huge reputation as someone who murders people from the Wen sect and likes it. He's the biggest Wen-hater in the book (for good reason), and LSZ is very scared that JC is going to find out who he is and whip him to death with Zidian. This is coupled with the fact that JC is the super-terrifying father-in-law, and so I think LSZ has the right to be a little nervous.</p><p>On another note, would you guys like me to throw in a bit of Wen Ning/Lan Jingyi too?

    <p>Lan Yuan feels like his heart is about to beat right out of his chest. He is acutely aware that he’s alone in a room with Sect Leader Jiang with the door locked; he is equally aware that that is probably the worst decision he’s ever made.</p><p>“Uncle doesn’t like to have important discussions in front of other people,” Jin Ling had said, nodding sagely. And like an imbecile, Lan Yuan had listened, wanting to make a good impression on the other boy’s guardian by considering his preferences. It’s only now that he realises there’s probably a good reason for those preferences. He should have considered that his survival is infinitely more important than making a good impression.</p><p><em>He’s going to beat you to death with Zidian and then toss the body in the river</em>, a voice in his head supplies. It sounds suspiciously like Wei Wuxian. <em>They’ll never find your corpse</em>, the voice continues helpfully.</p><p>Lan Yuan has definitely been spending too much time with his adoptive father. But even that is precious little comfort – Wei Wuxian was nowhere to be found when Lan Yuan had panicked and needed advice on handling Sect Leader Jiang.</p><p>Now, standing in front of him, Lan Yuan is pretty sure <em>no one</em> can handle this man. Sandu-Shengshou is over six feet tall – a little shorter than his Ah-Die – but every inch of him radiates the kind of aggression that Lan Yuan’s almost never seen his Ah-Die show. Only when Wei Wuxian, and sometimes Lan Yuan, is being threatened; Jiang Wanyin has it turned up to ‘maximum’ <em>all the time</em>.</p><p>His lips peel back in a menacing grin, and light flashes off his ring. Zidian, the weapon used to torture countless demonic cultivators to death. The whip of purple fire that had ended the lives of so many members of the Qishan Wen sect. Lan Yuan’s sect.</p><p>A shiver runs down Lan Yuan’s spine. The hairs on the back of his neck prickle. He counts backwards from ten, just as his Ah-Die taught him to do, takes a deep breath to calm his racing heart, and fights the urge to touch the sword at his side.</p><p><em>He can’t know</em>, he reassures himself, trying to quell the irrational fear that’s twisting his stomach into knots. No one knows, except for his Ah-Die, Wei Wuxian, and his uncle, Lan Xichen. And Jin Ling.</p><p>He’s known for nearly a year now, since they first began their relationship. It was the first thing Lan Yuan told him, after he had gathered up the courage to kiss Jin Ling, and overcome his shock when the younger boy kissed him back.</p><p>He pulled Jin Ling aside and confessed to him, in low hushed tones, who he was: the last living member of a sect that had wrought nothing but death and destruction, that had burned entire sects to the ground for no reason other than that they could, that had killed Jin Ling’s own grandparents. Lan Yuan told Jin Ling his greatest secret – the one that had been eating him up inside since the day he found out about it – because it was better for him to know now, when Jin Ling could still back out, than later, when the discovery could wreck so much more. When Jin Ling’s rejection would destroy <em>him</em> along with their – friendship? – with whatever this was that was blooming between them.</p><p>“I understand if you’d rather not see me again,” he whispered, and he’d half-believed it too. But Jin Ling scoffed, said “fuck that”, and pulled him in for another kiss.</p><p>Later, face still beet-red, shocked at his own boldness, Jin Ling declared to Lan Yuan that he wasn’t his family, that he shouldn’t let the dead run his life. And that was the moment Lan Yuan realised that he was head-over-heels in love with the young heir to the Lanling Jin sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, his biggest obstacle to that is now standing right in front of him, looking like he wants to rip Lan Yuan into little, tiny pieces for even daring to look at his nephew. <em>He can’t know</em>, he repeats to himself one more time, fortifying his defenses and attempting to channel his Ah-Die’s legendary calmness.</p><p>As Jin Ling says, no matter what he might have been born as, he’s a Lan now. And he’s going to act like it.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang, I believe you are aware of the… relationship between myself and Young Master Jin?”</p><p>The eyebrow lift that follows his question is impressive, to say the least. Lan Yuan can definitely see where Jin Ling gets that habit.</p><p>“Quite,” Sandu-Shengshou says coolly. He drops the smile, his face reverting to its customary scowl. It’s odd that Lan Yuan finds that a little less unnerving. “I do, however, confess myself confused.”</p><p>“Confused?”</p><p>Lan Yuan’s palms start to sweat. Suddenly uncomfortable, he shifts his weight a little, so subtly that it’s almost imperceptible. A gleam appears in Sect Leader Jiang’s eyes, and Lan Yuan realises that the older man was watching for the movement. He’s <em>enjoying</em> this, making Lan Yuan squirm under his scrutiny.</p><p>That knowledge bolsters him somewhat. Lan Yuan has never been one to back down from a challenge; he likes to think he gets it from his Ah-Die, and his reputation of ‘being where the chaos is’. Suddenly, he feels a lot better about his ability to handle the situation.</p><p>“Yes. What do you hope to get out of it? This, ah, liaison with my nephew? The heir to the Lanling Jin sect, one of the most powerful clans. And by far the wealthiest. Quite the match, isn’t it? Very… politically advantageous.”</p><p>The other man’s voice is steel. It drops a register, going dangerously low. Despite his newfound confidence, Lan Yuan has to suppress a shiver. Jiang Wanyin is not a man to be trifled with, especially for someone like himself.</p><p>He forces a placid smile, trying his best to mimic his uncle. Lan Xichen exudes an effortless sense of amiability that makes him seem impervious to others’ verbal attacks and psychological games. Or perhaps his unwavering kindness simply makes everyone else feel guilty for even attempting to bully him. Regardless, it’s a trait Lan Yuan has always admired.</p><p>“Indeed,” Lan Yuan returns. “But that is not why I have chosen to pursue him.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Young Master Jin is one of the best people I know. He is brave and kind, and though he can be arrogant, he has a good heart and does not hesitate to stand up for what is right. He is also exceedingly dedicated to the ones he cares about. I imagine that is something you understand as well.”</p><p>Lan Yuan feels jittery, the way Jingyi sometimes gets after he’s eaten too many sweets when Lan Qiren isn’t looking. There’s a feeling fluttering in the pit of his stomach, slithery and elusive like the moment after he discovered that Wei Wuxian was his adoptive father.</p><p>Sect Leader Jiang pauses for a moment. His expression is unreadable, even to Lan Yuan, who has spent nearly all of his childhood attempting to decipher Lan Wangji’s facial cues.</p><p>“That may be so. But what can <em>you</em> offer him? What do you have to give him that he would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere? Gifts? Jin Ling is a future sect leader; he will want for nothing. Protection? For all his youth, he is a powerful cultivator in his own right, and he will only improve with time. A future? You are not a woman; you cannot give him an heir. I know Jin Ling’s worthiness, Lan Sizhui, but you have not yet convinced me of yours.”</p><p>His words are insulting, yes. If Lan Yuan had been raised in any other sect, he might be having a hard time reining in a desire to punch the older man in the nose. But he is a disciple of the Gusu Lan sect, the adopted son of Hanguang-Jun, and so he has been trained to look past simple surface meanings, to see things as they really are.</p><p>And Jiang Wanyin, for all his abrasiveness and apparent rudeness, is not looking down on him. Rather than condescension or animosity, there is something reserved about his tone. Almost calculating.</p><p>Lan Yuan is standing on the edge of a precipice, the tips of his boots stuck out into empty air, an inch or two of heel the only thing keeping him on solid ground. A single gust of wind could push him over; send him falling to his doom. This is it, the crucial moment – make or break.</p><p>He takes the plunge.</p><p>“I understand the issues you speak of. I have considered every facet of them. And here is my answer: it is true that I cannot give him any of those things. Neither do I wish to. Jin Ling is his own person; I will not attempt to shower him with gifts or shield him from the world.”</p><p>Here, he emphasises the other boy’s birth name, pointedly omitting the honourific. Sandu-Shengshou stares at him in stoic silence.</p><p>“I wish only to stand by him when he faces conflict, to let him know that he is not alone. You say that I cannot give him an heir – that is biologically impossible. But I am eighteen years old. Jin Ling is sixteen. We have our lives ahead of us to solve that problem. And is it not his choice, in the here and now?”</p><p>His voice rings clear in the quiet hall, unwavering.</p><p>“I have chosen Jin Ling, Sect Leader Jiang. I ask you to give him the chance to choose me as well.”</p><p>A faint light shines in the other man’s eyes. Lan Yuan has the feeling that he’s just gone through a test of some sort, and his performance has been met with approval.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin tilts his head, face settling into the familiar lines of a frown.</p><p>“Very well then, Lan Sizhui. I think I may grow to like you.”</p><p>A weight has been lifted from Lan Yuan’s chest. He feels so much lighter now, as if he could leap five metres in the air if he tried. Though he senses a ‘but’ coming.</p><p>He is proven correct when the sect leader opens his mouth again.</p><p>“But if you break my nephew’s heart, I will make the fate of every demonic cultivator that has dared to show their face in the last fourteen years look like child’s play. There are worse places to die than Luanzang-Gang.”</p><p>With those chilling words, Jiang Wanyin sweeps out of the lecture hall in a whirl of purple robes. Lan Yuan lets out a breath he didn’t even know he was holding. Only now does he realise that his legs have been shaking the entire time.</p><p><em>That was the single most terrifying experience of my life</em>.</p><p>“Jin Ling,” he calls. “You can come out now.”</p><p>The other boy’s head appears in the doorway. The vermilion mark between his brows seems brighter than usual.</p><p>“Well? Do you still have all your limbs?”</p><p>Jin Ling stalks into the lecture hall, his characteristic swagger only half-hearted. Despite his gruff tone, he looks Lan Yuan up and down, eyes alight with poorly hidden concern.</p><p>Lan Yuan laughs. And laughs. And laughs some more. It’s not even that funny, but he can’t stop himself, and Jin Ling’s little indignant huff, him crossing his arms across his chest, just triggers something inside of Lan Yuan. He laughs until his stomach hurts and he’s clutching a nearby desk for support because his legs are made of jelly. He’s faced flesh-eating ghouls and soul-sucking zombies – the nastiest creatures the underworld has to offer – and a ten-minute heart-to-heart with Jin Ling’s uncle has scared him more than all of those things combined.</p><p>“This is very undignified, you know,” says Jin Ling. Lan Yuan can see he’s pouting, just a little. “Not behavior befitting a Lan. In fact, I’m sure you’re breaking at least three different sect rules right now.”</p><p>He wipes tears from his eyes and hiccups as the laughter slows to a stop. He’s so lucky to be alive right now.</p><p>“I think–” Another hiccup cuts him off. “I think your uncle likes me.”</p><p>“Don’t be ridiculous, Sizhui,” Jin Ling scoffs. “He doesn’t like anyone.”</p><p>Lan Yuan descends into another round of hysterics.</p>

          <p>Happy New Year guys! It's finally 2019! Last year was such a wild ride - I participated in a disastrous and regrettable Physics tournament, took my last Chinese exam ever after ten years of studying, and started this fanfic! Thank you to everyone who's been following me for the last few weeks; I have no words for how much I appreciate you guys. Hope you had a good year, and will have an even better one to come :)</p><p>Today's author's note will be pretty short, because it's past two in the morning right now, and I'm really tired. I just had to get this chapter up, because I've been out most of today and my family did our yearly post-Christmas 'throwing things away' spree. I've also been procrastinating like crazy.</p><p>Anyway, I spent a good two hours today listening to the Tumblr-recommended song 'Falling Apart' by Michael Schulte, and oh boy. It was really hard not to cry at all the Yunmeng brothers feels. Please give it a listen if you've got time. Also, I discovered this amazing XiCheng fic yesterday, called 'Except For When I'm Missing You' by the uber-talented t_why, and struggled not to ugly cry the whole time I was reading it. Seriously - it's beautiful and angsty, and t_why's LXC and JC are done so perfectly that it's heart-breaking. The fic only has three chapters, and it's a WIP, but don't let that put you off.</p><p>As always, hope you enjoyed the chapter and once again, happy new year!</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>The nightmares come again tonight. After two nights of dreamless sleep, Jiang Cheng should have known it was too good to last. He’d thought today was a good day, all things considered, but then he’s had good days before, and that never seems to chase away the awful things he sees during the nights.</p><p>Tonight, he dreams of being seventeen again, in the days after his home burned down and he witnessed his parents’ murder.</p><p>
  <em>Wen Zhuliu’s hand is planted firmly on his chest, a searing heat emanating from the point of contact, turning his blood to fire. He screams; it feels like something inside him is melting – a white-hot pain that sets all his nerve endings ablaze.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And afterwards, nothing. Just a hollowness in his chest where his golden core used to be. Yes, it hurts. There are little lightning bolts of agony that spark inside him at any sudden movement, sometimes without provocation, but they are like the phantom pains of a severed arm. Only this is worse.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For a cultivator, a severed arm is nothing. Hell, Jiang Cheng’s heard of the story of Xiao Xingchen and his lost eyes, and how he’d still managed to go on night-hunts and slay fierce corpses. Because his cultivation had been strong, and the lingqi inside of him had been able to compensate for his lack of vision.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But a cultivator without a golden core is no cultivator at all. All his life, Jiang Cheng has trained and trained and trained, trying to strengthen his abilities, trying to be good enough and strong enough to make his parents proud. To make his sect proud.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And now all of that is gone, because all that Jiang Cheng was has been ground to dust beneath a Wen-dog’s heel, and he is nothing. An artist whose hands have been cut off can learn to draw with their feet, or hold a brush in their mouth to get the paint on canvas; a musician who has lost their voice can learn to play the guqin, or the xiao. But he is not either of those things. He is a cultivator without a golden core, missing the only thing about him that is valuable, and so that makes him worthless.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>(Jiang Cheng has known that to be true for nearly all his life, but to have the reality of it thrust in his face, with no hope of ever improving the situation, is nearly too much to bear.)</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The rain is pouring down and he is walking through the forest with his older brother. Both of them are soaked to the bone. Wei Wuxian shivers and Jiang Cheng’s teeth are chattering, but the chill that wraps itself around his skin is nothing compared to the feeling of emptiness inside him.</em>
</p><p>Jiang Cheng wakes up to skin prickling with cold, covers tangled around his ankles where he’s kicked them off in the middle of the night. His stomach is heavy with despair, slimy and settling in his innards to weigh him down.</p><p>There is a voice whispering low in his ear, spilling out words like ‘<em>worthless</em>’ and ‘<em>cripple</em>’ and ‘<em>weak</em>’. They burn like poison and sound like truth, and they slither down to join the oily mass in his gut that grows larger with every insult.</p><p>His golden core pulses inside his chest, warm and glowing and bright where it belongs, but Jiang Cheng wants to rip it out of him because <em>it doesn’t belong</em>. It’s not even his – his strength belongs to Wei Wuxian, was taken from Wei Wuxian, and the thing that’s protected him, that he’s relied upon for the past fifteen years doesn’t even belong to him.</p><p>He’d thought that he’d finally gotten strong enough, powerful enough to leave behind the angry little boy who was never as good as he was supposed to be. That he’d finally earned the recognition and respect he’d worked so hard for. But fate’s a bitch, isn’t she, and Jiang Cheng’s life has been nothing but a cosmic joke since the day he was born. He’s a fool to ever think it could be otherwise.</p><p>Instead, now he knows that that little boy never really grew up, and the strength he’s worked a decade and a half to build is never going to be enough to win back his self-respect, because the only thing that’s ever given him confidence is also a huge fucking lie.</p><p>The anger is back now, filling him up to the brim, but even that isn’t strong enough to burn away the hopelessness sitting in his stomach. His hands are trembling, and suddenly he’s consumed with loathing so strong he can’t feel anything else. He isn’t sure who it’s directed at. It might be himself.</p><p>The walls are closing in, and his chest feels like it could explode at any moment, like a child’s ball pumped too full of air. The voice in his ear is dying away now, though the silence is too loud in its absence. Jiang Cheng almost wishes it would come back.</p><p>He thinks he might be going insane.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The practice yard is empty this early in the morning. It’s not even three yet, and no one else is up. One thing about Lan sleeping habits is that they leave no room for insomniacs. Go to bed at nine, wake up at five, without fail. An assured solid eight hours of sleep every night – sounds fucking fantastic. Lucky bastards.</p><p>For the next three hours, Jiang Cheng doesn’t think; he just <em>moves</em>. Runs forwards and backwards through every sword exercise that he knows, mixes and matches techniques he’s been taught and those he’s picked up over the years. He hacks and slashes, thrusts and parries, pulls out all his tricks but never, <em>never</em> does he exert his <em>lingqi</em>. His cultivation techniques remain unused; Zidian stays in ring form the entire time.</p><p>On some level, he knows he should practice that too, with all the other stuff, but everything in him shies away at even the thought of it. Instead, he launches himself into a backflip, and pushes everything else to the back of his mind.</p><p>When he’s finished, Jiang Cheng is breathing heavily and covered with a sheen of sweat, but he’s let out almost all his aggression and the rage in him has finally been wrung dry. Small enough now that he can fold it up and tuck it back behind a curtain, where he can pretend it’s not there.</p><p>He sheathes Sandu and straightens his robes, heads back to his assigned quarters to wash up and get ready for the day ahead.</p><p>Then he rouses Jin Ling, who looks strangely smug for a teenage boy who’s been woken up before nine. His nephew won’t say what about, but Jiang Cheng has a sneaking suspicion that it has something to do with the conversation he had with Lan Sizhui yesterday.</p><p>Damn it. He <em>knew</em> he was being too soft. Should have thrown in some more theatrics. Maybe thundered a bit.</p><p>But the kid was so fucking earnest, had said all the right things and clearly adored Jin Ling. Plus, he’d trotted out those puppy eyes, somehow exactly like his uncle’s without being either the same size or shape, and Jiang Cheng just couldn’t muster the desire to bully him.</p><p>Oh, yeah. He’s definitely gone soft. At the ripe old age of thirty-four, too.</p><p>Well, he’ll just have to make up for it by redoubling his efforts to threaten Jin Ling. (Which doesn’t really work, because he has to tell his nephew thrice to quit smirking before Jin Ling stops looking like a cat that has managed to swallow a particularly obese canary. Jiang Cheng fucking hates cats. Dogs are vastly superior in every way.)</p><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Cheng does his best to make Jin Ling hurry, which he is clearly not built for. The kid takes four tries to do his hair in a manner that he finds satisfactory. <em>Four tries.</em> To tie a damn ponytail. If the entire cultivation world didn’t know that he raised Jin Ling himself, Jiang Cheng would be tempted to pretend they’re not related. Gods know the kid is clearly Jin Zixuan’s spawn.</p><p>Finally, after what seems like an eternity, Jin Ling is ready, and the two of them leave the building that contains the sect leaders’ quarters. They make their way to the pavilion with about ten minutes to spare – plenty of time – and take their seats with a minimum of difficulty.</p><p><em>Here we go again</em>, Jiang Cheng sighs. Another three hours discussing unity with a bunch of people who hate each other. Oh, joy of joys.</p><p>But then he thinks about what comes afterwards, and he lets himself acknowledge that the meeting might not be so bad.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Contrary to popular belief, not all Lans are morning people. Lan Huan certainly isn’t. It’s seven in the morning, and he’s been up for two hours and about four cups of strong tea, which is all that fits in the pot. Unlike his brother, who gets up at five and is immediately ready to face the world, Lan Huan requires some waking up first.</p><p>At least, when he gets a good night’s sleep. Which he has, surprisingly, for the first time in weeks. Maybe months, not counting the night he spent unconscious from ingesting alcohol.</p><p>His dreams last night were peaceful, free from the blood and death that so often haunts them. It is a rare gift, and Lan Huan intends to treasure it.</p><p>The sun is just peeking above the horizon, spilling light onto the wooden floor when Lan Huan pulls himself up into a handstand position. Everyone in Cloud Recesses goes through these exercises every day – it’s one of the reasons their sect is known for their prodigious arm strength – but Lan Huan likes doing them at dawn best.</p><p>He likes watching, upside down, as the sky lightens from indigo to pink, then back to a shallow blue, while the first golden rays of sunlight fall to earth. It is quiet and beautiful, the only sound the chirping of the birds nearby.</p><p>Shu-Fu would say that taking such pleasure in a worldly occurrence is frivolous. But then, Lan Huan thinks wryly, Shu-Fu is not here at the moment.</p><p>His arms are just beginning to burn when a knock comes on the door to the cottage. Lan Huan is startled for a moment, but regains his balance before he can fall over with an undignified ‘thump’.</p><p>“One moment,” he calls, retracting his legs and standing back up. His heart beats a little faster at the thought of who could be at the door. But no – it’s too early for that, not even ten o’ clock yet. The meeting isn’t supposed to end until eleven.</p><p>He doesn’t know why his stomach sinks a little in disappointment.</p><p>Still, whoever this is must be someone new. Wangji knows not to visit him this early, and anyway, his little brother should be preparing for today’s gathering at this present moment. Lan Huan smoothes his features into a placid, smiling expression. He takes the few steps over to the front door and unlocks it, pushing it open. The sight that greets him is one that he had not expected.</p><p>There, standing on his doorstep, hair up in a messy ponytail and wearing a sheepish grin, is Wangji’s husband, the Yiling Patriarch. Wei Wuxian.</p><p>The grin falters at the surprise on Lan Huan’s face, but it returns in full force as quickly as Lan Huan wipes the shock from his countenance, once again burying it under a genial look.</p><p>“Good morning,” Lan Huan greets politely.</p><p>The other man takes a deep breath, obviously gathering courage to do something. Inwardly, Lan Huan is confused. Why is Wei Wuxian here, never mind at seven-thirty in the morning? Why does he look so nervous?</p><p>Wei Wuxian is almost subdued as he opens his mouth.</p><p>“Good morning, Sect Leader Lan. I’m here to apologise.”</p>

          <p>Hey everybody! Hope your new year is getting off to a great start!</p><p>In case you were wondering where I was yesterday, I uploaded a XiCheng one-shot for New Year's Day, and I'm kind of proud of it. So please make sure to check it out!</p><p>Today, I'd like to rec a fic by Bgtea: 'How To Escape Your Problems And Live Life In Denial - The Jiang Cheng Edition'. It's a laugh-out-loud fluffy XiCheng modern AU, starring Jiang Cheng as the grumpy dude who does the latte art in the neighbourhood cat café, and Lan Xichen as the hot guy who won't stop coming to visit him. It's super well-written, and perfectly fills the massive angst-shaped hole left by MDZS canon.</p><p>Also, if you're looking for a song to listen to, I'd highly recommend 'You Said You'd Grow Old With Me', by Michael Schulte (as you can probably tell, I've been listening to a lot of his music). It fits the JC-WWX dynamic so well, and I nearly cried the first time I heard it. So many Yunmeng Bros feels.</p><p>Anyway, today's chapter was a little bit of a filler, because I was trying to figure out what should happen after JC gives LSZ the shovel talk. So now we have 2,000 words of JC angsting, then burying his issues by forgetting about them and getting irritated at JL instead. Someone needs to take that man to therapy.</p><p>I also included the bit where he was thinking about losing his golden core because it was probably a very traumatic experience, and even though we see in the novel how the realisation that WWX donated his golden core to JC affects the relationship between them, we don't get anything about how said realisation impacts JC's own mental state. Personally, I think it's going to be a big blow to him, especially considering the kind of person that he is. In canon, he doesn't really have a lot of people who care about him (JL is basically the extent of it), and so a lot of his identity is wrapped up in his performance as a cultivator and as a sect leader. Add that to his parental issues, and well, this is a nightmare waiting to happen. So, yeah. I'm not sure how this will be received, though, because I haven't really seen any content (Tumblr posts or fanfic) dealing with JC's reaction to the golden core reveal. Just hope I'm doing justice to the characters :)</p><p>The next chapter will include WWX clumsily attempting to apologise for The Prank, and LXC gaining some new insights into the relationship JC has with his adopted brother.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed, and see you next time!</p>

    <p>The words hit Lan Huan with the force of a charging ox. Wei Wuxian, apologise to him? Why would he – oh.</p><p>“Come in, then,” he says, his tone mild. He retreats back inside the cottage and the other man follows him hesitantly.</p><p>It’s not the first time Wei Wuxian has been here – he had been a frequent visitor for the first few weeks of Lan Huan’s seclusion, had come with Wangji hovering over his shoulder like a concerned mother hen. It was a strange change, watching the younger brother Lan Huan had helped raise pour all of his heart and soul into taking care of another person. At least it had been, until the pregnant pauses and stilted silences that filled the spaces in their conversation (that Lan Huan <em>allowed</em> to fill those spaces) became too much for the younger man.</p><p>After that, his visits became ever more infrequent, until they finally dropped off altogether. Lan Huan has not allowed himself to voice the relief he’s felt since then. It is uncharitable and unkind, to think such things of the man who makes Wangji happy.</p><p>(He remembers a time when the only thing his little brother felt was despair. That had been Wei Wuxian too.)</p><p>“Have a seat, Young Master Wei,” he says, polite but formal. Obediently, Wei Wuxian sits down on the straw mats laid out on the floor. His manner is almost meek.</p><p>Instead of joining him, Lan Huan goes into the kitchen and fills two mugs with the weak tea he keeps in the pantry. As he does so, he catches sight of the white-and-blue ceramic jar that Jiang Wanyin delivered to him two nights ago, now empty and dry. Unused. A strong urge to pour the tea into it and take it outside for Wei Wuxian to watch bubbles up within him.</p><p>It is only through sheer force of will that he does not indulge it. No, that would be simply petty behavior. And in very poor taste.</p><p><em>But</em>, a small childish part of him insists, rubbing its hands together gleefully, <em>it would also be very much fun</em>.</p><p>Lan Huan ignores it and carries the mugs out into the living room, where Wei Wuxian is waiting quietly. The bright grin has wilted somewhat, his shoulders hunched inwards, and his hands shake when he takes the tea than Lan Huan offers him.</p><p>“So, what did you come to speak to me about?”</p><p>Lan Huan settles into a kneeling position of his own, resting the warm mug on his thighs. Across from him, Wei Wuxian takes a cautious sip of his tea, relaxes a little when it does not burn his tongue. Then he sets the mug down, and begins.</p><p>“I am so, so sorry for what I did the other night.” The words come out in a torrent, rather like unstoppering a dam. Lan Huan wonders how much effort it took to pull the plug out in the first place. “The stunt I pulled with the alcohol and the tea – it was awful of me. I shouldn’t have done it, especially not here. I meant it to be a harmless bit of fun, but I went overboard; I made you break your own sect rules, and I know that’s not something that’s easy to forgive.”</p><p>The other man’s eyes are fixed on Lan Huan’s own, unwavering. He sees regret in them, and realises that it is sincere. The tightness that has been gathering in Lan Huan’s chest loosens a little.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Wei Wuxian repeats. “Please don’t blame my brother for it. He didn’t know, I swear. I tricked him as much as I tricked you, and he had some… words to say about what I did. It’s not Jiang Cheng’s fault.”</p><p>For the first time, Lan Huan notices the dark purple shadows blooming like fresh bruises under the younger man’s eyes. He looks tired, and suddenly Lan Huan remembers the way Jiang Wanyin looked yesterday, when he first entered the cottage. Drained and exhausted and absolutely <em>destroyed</em>. As if everything good had been squeezed out of him like an over-wrung sponge.</p><p>Lan Huan knew something had happened – just not exactly what. And now Sect Leader Jiang’s older brother is sitting in front of him, looking as though he didn’t manage even a wink of sleep all last night. As though he was kept up.</p><p>It doesn’t take a genius to put two and two together, and Lan Huan has always been told he’s of above-average intelligence.</p><p>Both men obviously had a fight yesterday – “some words” doesn’t do it justice, either. And over what? Over him? A pathetic excuse for a cultivator – for a sect leader – who locked himself away from the world when everything got too hard?</p><p>Lan Huan immediately recoils from the thought. No – it’s wrong; it’s bad to think that way. To think the entire world revolves around him and his problems. It’s written in the sect rules, number one thousand and twenty-three: <em>one must not harbor selfish delusions of one’s own importance</em>.</p><p>There must be another reason. There has to be.</p><p>His chest aches, so he opens his mouth instead. His cheeks are sore from smiling.</p><p>“I know. I do not fault him.”</p><p>As Wei Wuxian huffs a breath of relief, Lan Huan remembers the fear that gripped him when he awoke that morning to find he remembered nothing from the night before. When he found the note that he thought meant he’d somehow disgraced his sect. The cold terror that ran down Lan Huan’s spine and the sting like pulling ice away from where it sticks to bare skin, because Jiang Wanyin had talked to him, drank tea with him, <em>smiled</em> at him.</p><p>Lan Huan digs his nails into his palms. Lets the bite of it jolt him back to the present. Somehow that hurts less.</p><p>His brother-in-law is smiling again. It is not like his other smiles, carefree and bright, or else forced and tacky, like day-old polish scrubbed over a worn table to make it look new. This is raw, honest. Open, as though Lan Huan’s assurance that Wei Wuxian’s little brother is not to blame has lifted a weight off his shoulders.</p><p>“Thank you. And again, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Lan Huan thinks back to yesterday afternoon – the conversation he shared with the younger sect leader. At first, Jiang Wanyin had clammed up at even the mention of Wei Wuxian, had gone terse and taciturn when he suddenly remembered that the story he was telling involved the man in some way. But later, as the hours wore on, he became freer with his words. Talked about his childhood and the pranks his older brother had pulled with the adoration of a younger sibling.</p><p>And now, Wei Wuxian is here. Trying, however clumsily, to absolve the other man of the consequences of something <em>he</em> did.</p><p>It reminds Lan Huan of himself, in a way. In their youth, he had his small rebellions – smuggling chili oil up from the village to put in the elders’ dinner. Wangji, ever the studious, obedient one, had nonetheless looked at his big brother with large, silent eyes and followed where his schemes took them.</p><p>But when the elders found out, when push came to shove, Lan Huan always stepped forward and told the truth. Took the blame, the silencing punishment, the lines and the sometimes-beatings, so that Wangji would be spared.</p><p>He softens a little. Allows his stiff smile to be replaced by a more genuine one.</p><p>“I accept your apology,” says Lan Huan. He swears he hears a “thank the gods” from Wei Wuxian, but it’s impossible to prove, and he’s not going to attack the other man’s dignity that way.</p><p>It must be difficult enough to come all this way to beg for forgiveness. For the Yiling Patriarch, once among the most powerful cultivators in the world, to say the word “sorry” to a man whose cowardice is agreed upon by every sect.</p><p>The same petty voice from earlier reminds him that it is no less than what Wei Wuxian richly deserves. <em>Please be quiet</em>, he tells it.</p><p><em>Thirteen years</em>, it hisses back. <em>Thirteen years that Wangji was a wreck, that he barely spoke and barely ate and never smiled. He played Inquiry every day until his fingers bled, fought the elders, scarred himself over and over and over again. He shattered, and you were the one who had to pick up the pieces</em>.</p><p>
  <em>Stop it.</em>
</p><p>The voice continues, louder than before. <em>You were the one who brought him food every day and watched him to make sure he forced it all down. You were the one to bandage his hands when the skin broke and the blood seeped through. You were the one who saw him cry</em>.</p><p>He clenches his fists again, feels the crescent-shaped indentations form in the flesh of his palms. The voice falls silent.</p><p>This is his problem. He knows that now.</p><p>Wei Wuxian <em>died</em>. It wasn’t his fault, and Lan Huan is a horrible person for blaming him. The man was dead, a spirit left to wander the ghostly realm and the nine springs, while there was no one to burn paper money and food and shelter for his ghost. But he’s moved on.</p><p>Wangji was the one who had to deal with the aftermath. The one who lost the person he loved, who mourned for him with a grief so strong it nearly destroyed him. Part of his soul was cut out that day, and it didn’t start to heal for thirteen years. But he’s moved on, too.</p><p>Why is Lan Huan the only one who hasn’t?</p><p>Why does he still wake up with his brother’s name on his lips, with the urge – no, the <em>need</em> – to see him, to know that he’s alright, because he’s terrified that Wangji is going to hurt himself again, and he won’t be there to stop it?</p><p>Why does he, too, feel as though a piece of him is missing? One that Wei Wuxian’s return couldn’t fill in, since Wei Wuxian was never a part of him to begin with?</p><p>Lan Huan wants to scream and cry and rage at the world, but especially at himself. Instead, he waits until his guest finishes his tea and escorts him to the door. He only closes it when Wei Wuxian disappears around the first bend in the corridors.</p><p>Exhausted, he leans against the door, back pressed to the wood. And he breathes.</p><p>
  <em>In, out.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In, out.</em>
</p><p>Just how his father taught them.</p><p><em>In, out</em>.</p><p>Then he hauls himself upright and walks to the kitchen to wash the mugs. Trudges back to the centre of the living room. The floor is washed gold with sunlight, but there are thick, dark grey clouds gathering on the horizon. It’s going to rain later.</p><p>Lan Huan sets his hands flush against the wooden floor, letting the heat of it warm his palms. He kicks his legs into the air, back into a handstand position. Just as he was before.</p><p>This time, he holds the pose until acid builds in his muscles and his arms are trembling so violently that he’s uncertain of his balance. It’s a long time, but shorter than usual, which is telling of his mental state.</p><p>Afterwards, he gets up and goes to his desk to write reports and fill out the pile of forms someone left on his doorstep while he was asleep. Liebing, his <em>xiao</em>, is balanced precariously on the tiny nightstand beside his bed, so close to the edge that it might roll off at the slightest gust of wind.</p><p>The note from yesterday morning is still there where Lan Huan left it, pinned underneath the jade flute. The letters are bold, the strokes slashed with a certain amount of aggression, but the writing no longer looks ominous or threatening.</p><p>Lan Huan rearranges Liebing, then picks up the small paper square. He folds it, tucks in into an empty drawer, and smiles.</p>

I like WWX, I really do, but since this fic is from the POVs of JC and LXC - the two important characters who get very actually angry with him in the novel - it's probably going to lean a little in his disfavour that they're the ones telling the story here. Since LXC is upset with WWX allowing LWJ to pine after him for thirteen years by NOT TELLING LWJ HE LOVES HIM (communication is a beautiful thing, guys), and JC, for reasons I'm sure I don't need to bring up here (because y'all have already listened to me rant about a gajillion times).</p><p>In this chapter, though, I wanted to leave off with a little bit of hope for the betterment of the LXC-WWX relationship, as they're brothers-in-law and all, as well as an outsider's observation of the complicated, but deep, love our Yunmeng Twin Heroes have for each other. Don't worry, things will get better; there are just A LOT of issues for everyone to work through.</p><p>Next chapter: Jin Ling has a pretty good idea, and when it rains, it pours.</p>

    <p>The meeting, Jiang Cheng thinks, is going much better than he’d expected. It’s still not productive, by any definition of the word, but it’s closer to the calmer atmosphere of the first day that yesterday’s tense, hostile one.</p><p>There are a couple reasons for this.</p><p>Firstly, sometime yesterday afternoon, the three pairs of cultivators, who had challenged each other during the gathering earlier, squared up and duked it out in the practice courtyard. Lessons were put on hold for the occasion, and so the disciples got to watch as the most-venerated clan leaders pummeled each other with swords and fists. It was an entertaining spectacle, and very, very public.</p><p>Jiang Cheng didn’t see any of this, of course, holed up in Lan Xichen’s <em>hanshi</em> as he was, but Jin Ling, who was dragged along to watch by Lan Jingyi, is rather forthcoming with the details.</p><p>(By this, he means that his nephew spends fifteen minutes rattling on about every single blow dealt during the duels. And also giving his own opinionated remarks on some of the sect leaders’ fighting skills. Rather loudly, too. Jiang Cheng has to shush him repeatedly to avoid dirty glares from the others as Jin Ling whispers to him.)</p><p>Returning to the point, by the time today’s meeting starts, a firm hierarchy is already established between those who were the most argumentative yesterday. The six challengers, not coincidentally, were among them.</p><p>Now that the battles have been fought and won (or lost, depending on one’s perspective) in full view of everyone, no one can dispute the participants’ relative strength.</p><p>And so yesterday’s losers are cowed and meek, while the winners are too smug to kick up much of a fuss during the discussion. Thus, the meeting progresses as smoothly as anyone can hope. Jiang Cheng thinks sardonically that this is why challenges are allowed during these events.</p><p>There’s only so much testosterone buildup one can take, after all.</p><p>The air cleared, the convocation can now get back to <em>important </em>business. A few more ideas are put forward and this time, everyone seems to be more receptive. Surprisingly, the majority supports a suggestion made by the middle-aged leader of the Wu sect, a moderately sized clan located at the foot of a large mountain.</p><p>He’s proposed a coalition of sorts, signed by the leader of every sect, agreeing to join forces – military and otherwise – to protect each other, in the event that one of their number should attack another clan. The alliance would fight with the injured party in order to subdue the aggressor, and bring that sect to justice. It is a sensible idea, and it garners murmurs of agreement when Sect Leader Wu sits back down.</p><p>Nie Huaisang fans himself lazily. Today’s fan is black silk, the beast head motif of the Qinghe Nie sect painted across the fabric in gold.</p><p>“An excellent suggestion, Sect Leader Wu,” he drawls, his voice smooth like oiled glass. “But such a thing would require a great many hours of work to maintain it. I confess that as a fellow sect leader, I find my existing duties… time-consuming. There are only so many hours in a day, and I already feel as if I am being pulled in many directions at once.”</p><p>He gives a self-deprecating laugh. “Of course, I may be alone in this sentiment. Forgive me.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks around. Sees many of the others nodding. His skin prickles in irritation. Nie Huaisang has always been a lazy little shit, even during their schooldays. He’s tempted to call him short-sighted, but after everything that was revealed at the temple of Guanyin, Jiang Cheng isn’t sure he can say that about someone who played a thirteen-year long game that successfully fooled the entire cultivation world. The others, then. He has no qualms about calling <em>them</em> narrow-minded.</p><p>Can’t they see that this could make everything better? That it could keep a repeat of the Wens’ rise to power from ever happening? Could save lives, even entire <em>sects</em>?</p><p>He remembers being seventeen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Lan sect leader, a man a scant few years older than him. Begging Jin Guangshan to take a stand, to help them fight so that they all could live. Threatening him, even, because he knew that without the support of the Lanling Jin sect, they were outnumbered, and they would lose. And everything Jiang Cheng had worked so hard to hold together after the siege on Lotus Pier would collapse into dust.</p><p>Now the sect leaders have an opportunity to prevent something like that in the future, and they’re worried about how much time they have to <em>relax</em>? This is a joke. A fucking joke.</p><p>Jiang Cheng seethes inwardly. There’s a hurricane inside him, the rain lashing at his skin, the wind pounding his ribcage, demanding to be let out. He bites his tongue and holds it in.</p><p>The expression on his face is growing blacker and blacker with every minute that passes, with every person that <em>doesn’t</em> step forward to call Nie Huaisang out on this bullshit. He itches to do it, to be the one to yell at them all for being lazy, self-centred fuckers who for all their blabbing about their sects don’t actually give two shits about them. But that right there is the reason he can’t. He stands up, and everyone in this room will just disagree with him on principle.</p><p>Thunder rumbles faintly outside, the sound muted by the pavilion’s thick walls. It mirrors exactly what he’s feeling.</p><p>Beside him, Jin Ling twitches. His hand goes to his knee like he’s about to stand up, and Jiang Cheng nearly grabs his robes to pull him back down. The kid’s too young for this, he thinks, panicked. Jiang Cheng brought him along to <em>watch</em> – he’s only been mired in this swamp of a political scene for two-and-a-half days; there’s no way he’s going to be able to traverse it without getting bogged down.</p><p>Jin Ling is only sixteen years old. The others won’t take him seriously. Worse, Jiang Cheng’s nephew hasn’t yet learned how to curb his sharp tongue. If he offends someone today, the results could be catastrophic.</p><p>But as he gets to his feet, it dawns on Jiang Cheng that he can’t do anything about it. This is Jin Ling’s decision to make, his test to pass or fail. Yes, he may only be sixteen, but he’ll be sect leader in just over a year. If Jiang Cheng interferes now – if he pulls Jin Ling back into his seat or shushes him like a child – <em>that</em> will be the other clan heads’ first impression of him. An immature youngling to be silenced by his elders.</p><p>And that would be worse than <em>anything</em> Jin Ling could possibly say to alienate the others.</p><p>For the first time, Jiang Cheng can’t protect him. This is something the kid has to do on his own; somewhere he has to go where his uncle can’t follow. And Jiang Cheng is not ashamed to admit that that scares the living shit out of him.</p><p>Jin Ling clears his throat.</p><p>“Sect leaders, if I may,” he begins. Jiang Cheng is comforted by how smooth his voice sounds. How poised and confident. “Sect Leader Wu has a valid point; however, so does Sect Leader Nie. The duties you speak of are a heavy burden indeed, and any extra weight may be difficult to bear.”</p><p>He pauses here, straightening his posture to look taller. “Thus, may I suggest a compromise? A delegate appointed by the leader of each sect and sent to compose the board you speak of? They would be representatives of their respective clans – mouthpieces for the sect leaders, if you will – and any conclusions reached by the council during meetings would be fed back to their superiors. This has the potential to lighten the workload of everyone here today; would that be amenable to everyone who agrees with Sect Leader Nie?”</p><p>Jin Ling sits gracefully back down, and whispers fill the room. And they’re <em>good</em> whispers – murmurs of agreement and “Young Master Jin has made an excellent suggestion”.</p><p><em>Holy mother of mercy Guanyin-Pusa, the Heavenly Emperor and all four Dragon Kings of the Sea</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng can see Jin Ling’s hands trembling. Tiny ripples form at the surface of his tea as he lifts the cup to his mouth and drains half of it in a single swallow. A surge of emotion fills Jiang Cheng, cool relief mixed with something else. It’s hot and scorching, floods his lungs and every corner of his body, and he nearly forgets how to breathe.</p><p>He says nothing for the rest of the meeting – what little of it is left – only raises his hand in assent when Lan Qiren calls for a vote on Jin Ling and Sect Leader Wu’s proposal. As do most of those present: the majority the suggestion needs to go forward. He keeps his mouth shut when the gong sounds to signal the end of the gathering, and everyone stands to leave.</p><p>It is only when they are finally out of the pavilion, standing alone outside the wooden doors, under the awning that provides a shelter from the driving rain, that Jiang Cheng rests his hand on his nephew’s shoulder. The boy turns, startled by the contact.</p><p>He looks into Jin Ling’s eyes, sees uncertainty there. Pride in his achievement, a hope for praise, acknowledgement. Fear that his uncle will be angry with him.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s heart breaks a little.</p><p>“Good job,” he says, and Jin Ling lights up at the gruff words. Jiang Cheng can almost see the way the boy holds them – like they’re embers. Gingerly, as if they might burn, though he warms his hands against them all the same, sidles closer to bask in their dim glow.</p><p>But nothing more comes. Jin Ling’s face falls a little in disappointment, and Jiang Cheng nearly chokes as he tries to pull up words that refuse to come out at the bitter slump of his nephew’s shoulders.</p><p>“Thank you, Uncle,” he manages. And then he walks away, his footsteps both softer than usual and too loud at the same time.</p><p>As Jiang Cheng stares at Jin Ling’s retreating back, he thinks of all the things he can’t say out loud. Tries to think them loud enough that the boy can hear them.</p><p><em>I’m proud of you, Jin Ling. I’m so, so proud of you. Your mother and father would be, too</em>.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Outside the tiny cottage, lightning flashes. A boom of thunder follows close behind it, and Lan Huan tries to ignore the incessant roar of rain buffeting the roof. He is curled up in a hard wooden chair, having finished his paperwork for the day, a book on the greatest musicians of the last millennia open in his lap.</p><p>It’s not the most entertaining read, but it’s engaging enough, and it’s one of the only books in the cottage that he hasn’t already finished ten times. Lan Huan shifts a little in his chair so that the armrest isn’t digging into his back. Looks out the window.</p><p>He closed it, of course, when the first drops began falling. He’s not particularly good at housekeeping, and so the last thing he wants is water all over the floor that he will have to clean up later. But even with the window shut against the wind, there’s little Lan Huan can do about the mess the spring storm is making of the garden.</p><p>He sighs a little. The rain outside is coming down in sheets, so thick he can barely make out the edges of the white walls where the corridor that leads to this small part of Cloud Recesses ends. It’s probably going to drown the peonies, at the very least; Lan Huan is going to have to replant them when the storm ends. The lotuses will be alright, though. They thrive in this sort of weather.</p><p>Turning back to his book, he attempts to bury himself in the words, in stories about people who lived long before his time, and who died before it too. History is normally one of his favourite subjects, but today, he just can’t concentrate.</p><p>Seemingly of their own volition, Lan Huan’s eyes drift towards the clock set on the table in the middle of the room. It’s past twelve already. The meeting should have ended by now; perhaps–</p><p>Another crack of thunder cuts off his question before he can finish it. That’s as good an answer as any, Lan Huan supposes. He sighs again, determinedly not thinking about the sinking feeling in his stomach that cannot be explained away by simple disappointment at not hearing how the meeting went.</p><p>No one would be out in this weather if they could help it, especially not to visit <em>him</em>. No one sane, anyway. It would be much wiser to simply stay indoors, where it’s warm and dry, rather than to brave the downpour outside–</p><p>A sharp knock on the door cuts off Lan Huan’s train of thought for the second time in as many minutes. He fairly throws his book down on the table and half-runs towards the door, throwing it open to gusting wind, and a deluge that sprays his face and hair with water droplets, and…</p><p>And Jiang Wanyin, standing under the tiny shelter on his equally tiny front porch, clothes completely soaked and clinging to his skin. He’s scowling, water dripping off his chin to add to the puddle on the wooden floor below, and he looks uncannily like a half-drowned cat. Lan Huan must be desperate, then, because a bright warmth blooms in his chest at the sight, and he catches himself before he can think that this is the best thing he’s seen all day.</p><p>Lan Huan is almost expecting to hear a yowl when he opens his mouth, but all that comes out is Sect Leader Jiang’s familiar deep voice, pitched low and irritable.</p><p>“You people need to invest in a fucking roof.”</p>

          <p>Chapter Twenty-five tomorrow!!!!! So excited :)</p><p>Again, thank you all for following this fic. Reading your comments makes my day *so* much better.</p><p>Today's song recommendation is another Michael Schulte one (yes, I can see you rolling your eyes), called 'You Let Me Walk Alone'. This time, it's not related to our Yunmeng brothers in any way; rather, I think it describes the relationship between JC and JFM pretty well. Obviously, there are some glaring differences in that the singer in the song seems to have a great, healthy relationship with his father, who shows him he loves him. JC and JFM's relationship... not so much. Even though we all *know* that JFM loves his son deep down, JC does not, and hence their relationship is less warm and fuzzy. But the second part of the chorus, to me, is just beautiful and represents the dynamic between them excellently:</p><p>/You said I had one life, and a true heart;/<br/>/I tried my best and I came so far,/<br/>/But you will never know/<br/>/'Cause you let me walk this road alone./</p><p>So, yeah. Anyway, I hope you guys liked this chapter. In the next one, LXC kind of goes "full mother hen" on JC. Oh, I'm going to have so much fun with this.</p>

    <p>He’s lost his fucking mind. That’s all Jiang Cheng can think as Lan Xichen ushers him inside his (lovely, warm, <em>dry</em>) cottage and closes the door behind him against the wind and rain. What in hell’s ten courts possessed him to leave civilization – the pavilion and the network of buildings in Cloud Recesses that actually have covered walkways – to walk all the way out here in the middle of fucking <em>nowhere</em>? He’s gone insane; that’s the only reasonable explanation. No one goes to this much trouble to give a report.</p><p>The pouring rain was absolutely brutal. By the time he was even halfway to the cottage, he’d already been soaked all the way through to his underclothes. And because it’s spring, the water was fucking <em>cold</em>. Like little icy needles pricking at his skin.</p><p>So now he’s inside Lan Xichen’s house, dripping all over his clean hardwood floor, well aware that he looks like a wet dog. Hell, he <em>feels</em> like a wet dog. It’s not the most flattering he’s ever looked.</p><p>But the other man barely even notices the trails of water Jiang Cheng is leaving in his living room. Or if he does, he doesn’t say anything. Jiang Cheng spots a thick book lying open on the table, an uncomfortable-looking wooden chair pulled up next to it.</p><p>Despite the lingering wetness from the freezing spring rain, he feels his cheeks flush with embarrassment. Sect Leader Lan was obviously busy before he showed up, or at least enjoying himself reading. He hadn’t needed Jiang Cheng barging back in here (for the third time – this is getting to be a habit now, one he needs to break) and making a mess of his home. Probably doesn’t appreciate it either; Jiang Cheng knows <em>he</em> wouldn’t.</p><p>“I-I’m sorry to intrude,” he says, cursing himself for stuttering like an anxious teenager. What is it about these situations he keeps getting himself into, that they always make him act like a complete idiot?</p><p>“Don’t apologise,” Lan Xichen replies. He smiles kindly, showing straight teeth and– is that a fucking <em>dimple</em>? Oh, damn. If this were any other sect leader, Jiang Cheng would probably revel in the chance to make their life as inconvenient as possible. But with Zewu-Jun, he just feels guilty. “Besides, I said you were welcome to visit every day, did I not?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng just nods dumbly. His wet clothes are sticking to him, pressing the water against his skin. It’s really uncomfortable. And cold. Very cold.</p><p>“Thank you for deciding to visit. With the rain…” Lan Xichen pauses, glances down for a split second. He blinks, and all of a sudden, he looks a little shy. “I wasn’t sure you were going to come.”</p><p>The tone of his voice is even, but Jiang Cheng can hear so much unabashed, undisguised relief in it. It’s baffling, and his knees go a little weak at the thought that it’s directed at him. Because <em>he</em> bothered to come.</p><p>He opens his mouth to reply, to say something like <em>of course I was going to come, I don’t back down on my promises</em>. Something flippant and callous, that wouldn’t betray the flutter in his stomach at the other man’s words. Instead, he shivers.</p><p>Not a tiny one, either, the barely-noticeable kind. The cold seeps out of his clothes, worms its way into his bones, and Jiang Cheng shakes with it. His teeth knock together, and rather than actual human words, he produces an awful clacking sound that makes him cringe inwardly.</p><p>How humiliating, he thinks, even as his body continues to tremble. He feels soggy and frozen and miserable, and this is <em>not</em> the ideal state for him to be in in front of another sect leader. He’s supposed to be poised and in control of himself, gods-damnit, not quivering like a child with a nightmare.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s brows pull together. With the little crinkle in the centre of his forehead, he looks… concerned.</p><p>“You’re cold,” he says, stating the obvious.</p><p>Jiang Cheng grits his teeth in an effort to stop them from chattering. His body’s a fucking traitor. “N-no.” He knows he’s being stubborn, but he refuses to admit weakness. Not like this.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>The other man’s gaze drifts towards his clenched teeth, and the way he’s hunched in on himself, shivering pathetically. Lan Xichen gives him a reproving glance, those golden eyes chiding him. <em>Clearly not</em>, they seem to say.</p><p>Jiang Cheng raises an eyebrow defiantly. Which is quite a feat, all things considered. But the other man doesn’t seem to be impressed.</p><p>“You need a bath,” he states firmly. “You can use mine.”</p><p><em>What? </em>Jiang Cheng’s brain stutters to a halt. <em>What. The. Fuck?</em> Is Sect Leader Lan really asking him to take a bath in his house? He eyes Lan Xichen suspiciously. That ramrod-straight spine, the broad shoulders, the extra inch he has on Jiang Cheng; he cuts an intimidating figure, standing like that. Commanding. And the tone – it’s like he’s <em>daring</em> Jiang Cheng to argue with him.</p><p>Holy shit, he’s serious about this.</p><p>“I’m fine,” he insists, though he knows it’s a weak retort when Lan Xichen can actually see him shaking. “I’ve got a job to do; I can do it.”</p><p>“You won’t be able to do anything in this state, Jiang Wanyin. Much less give a full report on a political situation.” He looks almost exasperated, as though he’s chastising a younger sibling for not eating properly. <em>Lan Xichen, a mother hen. Who knew?</em> His voice is steely when he continues, and there’s a look in his eye that sends a tremor down Jiang Cheng’s spine.</p><p>(Of course it’s because he’s cold. What else could it be?)</p><p>“You <em>do</em> need to bathe, and get warm. You’ll catch a cold.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng wants to laugh at the absurdity of the situation. He almost does, but finally manages to get his mirth under control, covering it with a sarcastic snort. “It’s just a little rain. Besides, I can’t afford to get sick.”</p><p>He knows he’s messed up when a smug smile spreads across Lan Xichen’s face. Oh, yes; he walked right into this one.</p><p>“Exactly,” he says, widening his eyes and tilting his head in a manner that reminds Jiang Cheng uncomfortably of another night. Of cheap wine hidden in a jar and sitting on the roof looking at the stars.</p><p><em>No, don’t go there</em>. He desperately tries to think of something else, anything else, and tells himself he’s imagining the heat that pools low in his stomach at the memory of another person’s body pressed against his. Instead, he allows his mind to wonder if anyone else has ever seen the First Jade of Gusu like this, smirking and self-satisfied like he’s pulled one over on someone.</p><p>And apparently, that poor sucker is Jiang Cheng.</p><p>He sighs. Gives it up as a bad job. He can’t refuse any longer; rejecting another cultivator’s hospitality is a grievous offence. Especially another sect leader, and doubly so if that sect is the Gusu Lan clan. Ever the sticklers for propriety.</p><p>With very poor grace, he huffs out a “fine”. At that, Lan Xichen’s grin loses its smug note, though it only spreads wider. He looks genuinely pleased, and Jiang Cheng’s chest gives a little twist.</p><p>Ignoring it, he turns on his heel and heads for the bathroom. Stops abruptly when Lan Xichen’s voice rings out behind him again, strangely loud, even over the clamour of the rain outside.</p><p>“Your clothes,” he says. Still smiling, but there is a faint pink tinge to his cheeks that Jiang Cheng chooses not to mention.</p><p>“What about them?”</p><p>“They’re wet. You can leave them to dry here, if you want.”</p><p>“What do I wear, then?”</p><p>The taller man ducks his head, flushed even redder than before. Jiang Cheng swears he can almost see the blood rushing to Lan Xichen’s face. There’s an answering warmth in his own cheeks.</p><p>“I have… spare robes. If you don’t mind. They’re clean, and haven’t been worn in a while. You could… you could wear them. If you want.”</p><p>By the third repetition of the phrase, Jiang Cheng knows he’s been thoroughly suckered. Hook, line and sinker. The highest-ranked cultivator in the entire world is looking at him like a fucking puppy, asking if Jiang Cheng will wear his extra clothes like it’s some big favour and not Lan Xichen saving his sorry ass from hypothermia. He <em>cannot </em>say no. He physically can’t. He doesn’t think anyone could, in his position.</p><p>No one’s that heartless.</p><p>He nods, face on fire even though the rest of him feels like he’s been trapped in a giant ice block from the neck down. As Zewu-Jun disappears into his bedroom in search of the spare robes, he thanks the gods that no one is here to witness this complete and utter travesty. Wei Wuxian would–</p><p><em>Jin Ling</em> would snicker at him ‘till kingdom come. Behind his back, of course. The brat’s not yet quite daring enough to risk drawing his uncle’s ire.</p><p>Lan Xichen emerges from the doorway, a neatly folded pile of clothing in his arms. White, with the swirly little blue cloud designs that Jiang Cheng’s been making fun of for years. It dawns on him that he’s actually going to do this. Bathe in Sect Leader Lan’s house. Wear his clothes.</p><p>This is a terrible idea.</p><p>He takes the pile anyway, manages a gruff “thank you” before he escapes into the small bathroom that he found in his exploration of the cottage a mere two nights ago. Hopefully, it won’t cross Lan Xichen’s mind to ask how he knows where it is.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The water is scorching hot by the time the tub is full, steam rising from the surface. It raises the temperature of the whole room by a few degrees. Jiang Cheng’s clothes are no longer sopping wet, having shed most of the excess on Lan Xichen’s floor, but the material is still damp and restrictive.</p><p>He strips down and everything that was soaked on the way here comes off. Which basically means every article of clothing he has on him. He folds his robes as neatly as possible, glad to no longer be weighted down by the sodden material, and sets them to the side of the sink. He’ll dry those later.</p><p>His underclothes, though – <em>those</em> he’s going to have to put on again after the bath, wet though they might be. Jiang Cheng’s dignity has taken a battering today (it’s still being pounded into the ground, he thinks with a grimace); he flat-out refuses to borrow Lan Xichen’s underwear. He has <em>lines</em>, damnit.</p><p>He blames the steam filling every crevice in the room for the red he can just <em>feel</em> creeping along the tips of his ears. It has nothing to do with the mental image his stupid, traitorous brain has decided to inflict on him. Nothing at all.</p><p>Jiang Cheng lets out a hiss when his foot finally touches the water. After spending so long in wet clothes that leached the warmth from his body, the steaming bathwater burns like a blue flame licking along his skin. He scrambles in anyway, heedless of the white-hot sting that spreads to every point of contact with the water.</p><p>The tub is small, like everything else in this cottage. The top of it comes up to a little above his knees when he’s standing, and he has to scrunch his legs up against his chest so all his limbs will fit. Now, the only thing poking out is his head, and he hunches slightly to submerge his shoulders as well.</p><p>It’s utterly <em>glorious</em>. He’s up to his neck in sweet, sweet warmth and he’s not cold (or shaking) anymore, and the hot water relaxes knots in his muscles he didn’t even know he had. He lifts a hand to touch his face, and the skin feels like ice against his fingers.</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t want to move, but his hair is still rain-wet and his head is still freezing. Reluctantly, he folds his legs upwards until they’re out of the tiny wooden container, then eases forwards so he can lie flat on his back so his face is submerged.</p><p>When that’s done, Jiang Cheng sits back up and tucks his legs in again. He stays in that position until the water goes cold.</p>

    <p>As the minutes tick by and Jiang Wanyin does not emerge, Lan Huan becomes increasingly distracted. Agitated, even. He returns to his uncomfortable chair and tries again to immerse himself in the pages of his book, but he cannot stop himself from looking up, again and again, at the bathroom door.</p><p>To what end? Honestly, Lan Huan doesn’t know. He knows he would be able to hear if it opened, so this constant checking is simply an exercise in futility. And destroying his focus.</p><p>What was he <em>thinking</em>? Ordering Sect Leader Jiang into the bath as if he was a disobedient child, forcing him to <em>wear Lan Huan’s clothes</em> like a–</p><p>His brain stalls. <em>Do not complete that sentence</em>.</p><p><em>Possessive boyfriend</em>, his mind supplies helpfully, and Lan Huan abandons his book in favour of burying his face in his hands. This is something Wangji would probably do to his husband. In other words: a disaster of epic proportions. How is he going to be able to look Jiang Wanyin in the eye after this?</p><p>Lan Huan shouldn’t have done this – he really shouldn’t have. Jiang Wanyin is a grown man and a fellow sect leader to boot; he can take care of himself. It’s not Lan Huan’s place to tell him what to do, how to live his life.</p><p>Only the younger man had looked so cold and shivery and miserable, and every big-brother instinct in his body had shouted at Lan Huan to <em>take care of him</em>, because he was freezing and doubtless going to get sick as a result. Add that to the fact that he was only in such a state because he had tried to visit Lan Huan, so naturally Lan Huan felt guilty on top of everything else. Of course he hadn’t been able to stop himself. It was only to be expected.</p><p>Who is he trying to fool? Jiang Wanyin is a fiercely independent man, and Lan Huan’s latest stunt has probably offended his pride. And his dignity.</p><p>Lan Huan swipes his hands across his face, sighs and shifts his position to something more refined. When he’s sitting up straight, feet touching the floor instead of pushed up against the armrest, he picks up his book and attempts to read the same line he’s been going over for the better part of fifteen minutes.</p><p>Again, without success.</p><p>He’s just about to give up and start pacing instead when the bathroom door opens and Jiang Wanyin steps out. Lan Huan’s mouth parts a little in surprise. He looks… really good.</p><p>The borrowed robes hang a little loose on the younger man’s slightly smaller frame, especially in the shoulders, but that’s to be expected. The silver lotus-shaped bell has been untied from his original uniform and now dangles from the belt around his narrow waist.</p><p>The violet robes of the Yunmeng Jiang sect are a beautiful colour, to be sure, but they are also very dark, lending the wearer a sense of intensity that borders on fury. Out of them, Jiang Wanyin looks gentler somehow, softened, less a deadly weapon and more a young man. There is something in his face – a <em>look</em> he has about him – that Lan Huan has never noticed before: something almost pure about the way Jiang Wanyin looks at the world from behind his eyes, blue now instead of grey.</p><p>(Lan Huan can’t figure out what it is, and suddenly he wants to know. To watch him until he understands.)</p><p>The other man hovers outside the bathroom for a moment, as if unsure of what to do, before finally deciding to come into the living room. His steps are halting, less confident than usual, unused to the dress-like design of Lan sect robes rather than the trousers favoured by his own clan.</p><p>Lan Huan knows how it feels. The strange sensation of wearing clothes that are not your own, that do not come from your home. He remembers plain white robes without cloud designs, and the matter-of-fact voice of a boy saying “your clothes are too recognizable – you have to blend in”.</p><p>“I wasn’t sure what to do about my own robes,” Jiang Wanyin says, his tone almost apologetic. “I left them in the bathroom to dry, if that’s not too much of an imposition.”</p><p>A smile tugs at Lan Huan’s lips. “Don’t worry, it’s not.”</p><p>He pours tea for the both of them and carries it out. At this rate, he’s going to have to make more – much more, if he keeps receiving visitors as he has the past few days.</p><p>The two of them lapse into silence as they drink their tea, and Lan Huan takes the opportunity to continue studying the other sect leader. He looks different, Lan Huan thinks, and it isn’t just the change of clothes. It isn’t his imagination, either. Jiang Wanyin is calmer than Lan Huan has ever seen him, expression loose and relaxed. The ever-present tension in each line of his body is diminished to almost nothing, and his legs are curled beneath him graceful as a cat, instead of the rigidity Lan Huan has become accustomed to.</p><p>His hair is <em>down</em>, too, and it should have been the very first thing Lan Huan noticed, but for his preoccupation with the way Jiang Wanyin looks in his clothes. (That came out wrong, but it also makes Lan Huan’s chest warm, even though the tea isn’t hot enough to warrant such a reaction.) The cloth that holds it in its perpetual severe bun is gone – probably drying in the bathroom with the rest of his clothes – and the raven-black hair flows loose down his back, still wet.</p><p>It comes down past his waist, a little shorter than Lan Huan’s own, and the part of him that isn’t in shock notes that that is very long indeed. <em>No one</em> has ever seen Jiang Wanyin with his hair down.</p><p>(A few years ago, Lan Huan had the misfortune of being in the same eating house as a group of cultivators who made crude suppositions about whether Sect Leader Jiang would keep his hair tied up when he was in bed with his wife. Lan Huan had blushed very hard at the inappropriate comments, and was thankful when the speakers finally paid and left.)</p><p>Even now, he has to fight to keep the red from rising to his cheeks, and the other man eyes him strangely, as if sensing his embarrassment.</p><p>“Thank you for your hospitality,” he says instead, choosing not to mention it. “You’ve gone… above and beyond.”</p><p>Lan Huan laughs. “It was the least I could do,” he says lightly. “You came all the way out here to visit me, after all.”</p><p>“That’s true. I’ll give the report, then. Today’s meeting was rather eventful.”</p><p>Oh, yes. The report. The reason Jiang Wanyin is here to see him. He’d forgotten. It hits him like a physical blow to the stomach, and his chest goes unbearably tight. He’d <em>forgotten</em> until the younger man reminded him.</p><p>That they have a job to do, a political relationship to maintain. That they aren’t simply here to talk, or here because they want to be, but because they <em>have</em> to be. That they’re leaders of two completely different sects, and not just friends.</p><p>Lan Huan forces himself to breathe. <em>In, out. In, out. In, out.</em> Pushes away thoughts of silk fans and <em>guqin</em> lessons, familiar voices calling him “Xichen-Ge” and “Er-Ge”. Reminds himself of “it’s not your fault” and “you don’t deserve it” and “<em>you’re a good man, Lan Xichen</em>.”</p><p>It’s all right, he tells himself. Just because they are sect leaders, it doesn’t mean that they cannot also be friends. The two are not mutually exclusive. He’s fine. Everything is fine.</p><p>“Is there something wrong?”, the other man asks, those clear blue eyes boring into his own. There is concern there, hidden behind the brusque manner. Genuine, not contrived to play to Lan Huan’s emotions. Jiang Wanyin is honest, sometimes painfully so. He would not do such a thing. He may not even know how.</p><p>Lan Huan lets out a breath, eases his lips into a soft smile.</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong.”</p><p>“If you’re sure,” Jiang Wanyin says. His shoulders relax and he begins. The report is not long, but it is not short either, and Lan Huan anchors himself in the rise and fall of the other man’s voice as he describes the events of the morning. Sect Leader Wu’s proposal and Nie Huaisang’s protests, and Young Master Jin Ling’s sudden suggestion of compromise. Jiang Wanyin does not mince words – he lays everything bare on the table, gives Lan Huan the facts for him to pick over and come to his own conclusions.</p><p>Not once does he tiptoe around the subject of Nie Huaisang, even though Lan Huan can hear the disapproval clear in his tone when he brings up the sect leader’s not-so-subtle attempt at manipulating the gathering in his favour. For that, Lan Huan is grateful.</p><p>There is pride there, too, when Jiang Wanyin describes the way his nephew stood up in front of everyone and commanded attention. He does not voice it aloud, but there is an undercurrent of emotion in his voice, warm and gentler than most people could ever imagine.</p><p>And then it is over. Both of them have long since drained their tea, but neither brings up the possibility of refilling it. Lan Huan blinks, considering.</p><p>“Well,” he finally says, “I am glad to see that there is progress, at least.”</p><p>“Not enough.”</p><p>“Don’t say that,” he replies automatically. Lan Huan is caught off guard by his own friendly retort. The other man simply raises his eyebrow. “I only mean that optimism is a useful trait to have, is all. There are few things in this world that cannot be made to move along more smoothly with a positive attitude.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin smirks. “I am merely being realistic. We are three days into what was supposed to be a weeklong gathering, and only now are we finally getting somewhere. We cannot hope to reach an agreement, draw up sufficient plans and lay the groundwork for the arrangement itself in the time that remains to us.”</p><p>“Fair enough. You do have a point. Still…”</p><p>“As for yourself, my dear esteemed Sect Leader Lan, that is a rather realistic view of optimism, don’t you agree? Very pragmatic of you.”</p><p>Lan Huan opens and closes his mouth a few times, but nothing comes out. Unable to think of an appropriate argument, he smiles ruefully.</p><p>“I concede defeat, my <em>dear esteemed Sect Leader Jiang</em>.”</p><p>Now it is Jiang Wanyin’s turn to be speechless. His face flushes, the emphasis Lan Huan has placed on the last part of the sentence turning the tone far more intense than the careless words the younger man doubtless imagined them to be. His own words turned against him.</p><p>Still, he has a point. His logic is sound, and Lan Huan turns his argument over in his mind for a few moments. It bears reflecting on later, when Lan Huan is alone with his thoughts.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin is still floundering, so Lan Huan decides to take pity on him.</p><p>“Your hair,” he says. “It’s very long.”</p><p>Not the most tactful segue, perhaps, but this is Lan Huan’s house, and he does not particularly want to pass up an opportunity to satiate his curiosity. There are some perks to being a sect leader on one’s home ground, after all.</p><p>Blue eyes widen at the sudden change in subject. “Yes, I suppose it is.”</p><p><em>Excellent comment, Lan Xichen</em>, that persistent little mind-voice mocks him. <em>Not glaringly obvious at all</em>.</p><p>He ignores it.</p><p>“Is it a Yunmeng custom to keep it up like that? I’ve always wondered.”</p><p>“Not really. It’s more for practical reasons, to be honest. When he was little, Jin Ling used to pull my hair. He liked to hold things, you see.” Jiang Wanyin smiles. An honest-to-gods actual smile that shows perfectly straight white teeth, and lifts his whole face into an expression that looks like the first rays of sun on a clear morning. “It was all right until his teeth began coming in and he started to chew on it.”</p><p>“I can see how that would pose a problem.”</p><p>And then he <em>laughs</em>. It’s a deep, rich sound, and the most honest profession of mirth – or any sort of enjoyment or happiness, really – that Lan Huan has ever heard from him.</p><p><em>I want to hear that again</em>, says the little mind-voice. Lan Huan can’t find it in himself to disagree.</p>

          <p>Hey y'all!!! I'm back from a day of procrastinating and doing nothing. Which, in case you were wondering, is the one and only reason I didn't post yesterday. (Yeah, I know I'm really, really lazy. Sorry.)</p><p>I know this has absolutely nothing to do with MoDaoZuShi or this fic, but I'd like to recommend a very excellent novel called "Theonite: Planet Adyn" by the exceedingly talented M.L. Wang. It's the first part of a series, and I read it a couple years ago, and loved it. It's sci-fi and adventure, and there's some maybe-magic? in there, and the friendships between the characters are really well-done. So, yeah, I hope you'll go and check it out.</p><p>Anyway, back on topic. Today's chapter was mostly kind of fluffy and relationship-focused. I'm sorry if they seem a little bit out-of-character; I'm still practicing with the voices and stuff. But basically, LXC's little mini freak-out halfway through there is because he *forgot* that he and JC weren't just friends; that there's also a political aspect to their relationship, and that really threw him. Because thus far, every time he's been in a friendship with another sect leader (a.k.a. JGY and NHS), it's ended badly: while LXC tries to get both aspects to coexist peacefully, said other sect leader always prioritises the political part over the friendship. Naturally, he's a bit scared now. But he also figures that JC isn't going to do that - or at least, he's not going to do that and *lie* about it - so he's trying to convince himself to be brave and keep trying to handle friendships.</p><p>For his part, during the "banter" (I guess you could call it that), JC is a little awkward with his words, so he tends to lose arguments. He's got the spirit, though; just kind of inept at expressing himself (which I think is probably consistent with canon?).</p><p>Thank you all for reading, and I hope to see you again next time. 再见！</p>

    <p>The laugh comes out of left field. Really, it does. Jiang Cheng’s not the type to chuckle at his own jokes – or to chuckle at all. Scowls are more his thing. But he has the image of chubby two-year-old Jin Ling shoving a fistful of Jiang Cheng’s dark hair into his mouth fresh in his mind, and Lan Xichen’s deadpan expression and unexpected sarcasm just send him over the edge.</p><p>Huh. He never knew Lans could be funny. Except for Lan Jingyi, of course, but that kid holds the unfortunate title of “the most un-Lan-like Lan to ever Lan”, so he doesn’t really count. Okay, maybe that’s a little harsh, but still.</p><p>Lan Xichen is the leader of the Lan sect, the First Jade of Gusu, the eldest of Old Man Lan Qiren’s favourite nephews. He’s supposed to embody the Lan spirit in copious quantities, to be an unfeeling golem with a single facial expression. What he’s not supposed to be is sardonic and smart-assed, and he’s definitely <em>not</em> supposed to smile like <em>that</em> when he gets Jiang Cheng to laugh like he hasn’t in ages.</p><p>That smile crinkles the smooth skin at the corners of his melted-gold eyes and makes them shine, and it’s almost as if all the light in the world has suddenly decided to beam out of a single person. It’s so, so easy to see how this man holds the position of the cultivation world’s most sought-after bachelor when he grins like that, because objectively speaking, he’s really fucking attractive. Objectively speaking.</p><p>And Jiang Cheng could be jealous. He could despise Lan Xichen for being flawless and untouchable, so far away from the other mere mortals like him that the Lan sect leader might as well be the sun, but he doesn’t.</p><p>Because Lan Xichen <em>isn’t</em> flawless. He can’t cook and he likes feeding ducks, and he gets blackout drunk off of one mug of cheap wine and proceeds to be really fucking excited about everything. He cries and he’s insecure sometimes, and he worries about his asshole of a brother, even though he shouldn’t. Behind the placid smile and seemingly unshakeable demeanour, he’s just a person.</p><p>So even though Jiang Cheng <em>could </em>technically hate him, he actually can’t. And that’s a nice feeling.</p><p>He can’t remember what it’s like to not be angry all the time – it was so long ago that he’s swept it to the back of his mind with all the other trash he’s collected over the years. But when he’s here, in this tiny living room of a cottage with a flower garden, getting sassed by Sect Leader Lan of all people, he feels that again. Calm. At peace. As though he’s been caught inside a tornado for years and has finally reached the centre, and the winds raging around him have stilled.</p><p>
  <em>Is this what it’s like to be happy?</em>
</p><p>And oh, shit; he’s not prepared for that question. Because that means that he’s been miserable all these years on his own, and the only thing he needed to feel like a whole human being – <em>a whole person</em> – was someone else. It means that all this time he’s been fighting to be his own person, to claw his way out from under the shadows of his parents, his sister, his brother, was wasted. Because he’s a fucking <em>leech</em>, a climbing vine that can’t do anything on its own, that winds itself around the tallest, strongest tree it can find and grows upwards to reach the sun, all the while leaching nutrients from the soil and killing the tree that’s keeping it alive.</p><p>Jiang Cheng isn’t a climbing vine. He’s not. He doesn’t need anyone; he’s independent, he’s just fine on his own. Everything is fine.</p><p>But a tiny, traitorous part of his mind asks timidly, <em>we can still have friends, right? Lan Xichen is our friend, isn’t he?</em></p><p>And Jiang Cheng is <em>weak</em>, because he can’t say no.</p><p>Lan Xichen is still smiling at him. Jiang Cheng wonders if smiling that much has given him cheek muscles to rival his trademark Lan arm strength. He twists Zidian around his finger, and allows the familiar rotating motion to soothe the turmoil within.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the other man changes the subject again.</p><p>“You know, you’re not my first visitor today.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lan Xichen looks at him steadily, unwavering. “Wei Wuxian came this morning, during the meeting. He wanted to apologise.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s head is spinning. Wei Wuxian? What was he doing here? They haven’t spoken at all since their fight yesterday, and even though Jiang Cheng has done his best to push it all out of his mind, he can’t help the ache that runs through him at the reminder.</p><p>He doesn’t say a word, too preoccupied with the thoughts racing around in his head, but Lan Xichen seems to understand that he needs to know more.</p><p>“He told me that the, ah, mixup with the tea and wine was merely a prank on his part; not with any intention to offend. The former, you had already informed me; I myself had surmised the latter prior to Wei Wuxian’s visit. He was very adamant, however, that he clear up certain… possible misunderstandings.”</p><p>“What?”, Jiang Cheng croaks. His voice sounds rough even to his own ears, as though he hasn’t used it in weeks.</p><p>“Wei Wuxian came for <em>you</em>. He thought that I might blame you for everything that had happened. So he came to me to apologise, and to tell me that you had nothing to do with it. He asked me, repeatedly, not to blame you.”</p><p>The other man’s eyes are soft, and he’s looking at Jiang Cheng with an odd emotion in them. It’s warm and a little sad, but it’s not sympathy, so Jiang Cheng doesn’t feel the immediate urge to wreck something.</p><p>But <em>why</em>? Why would Wei Wuxian do this? Why would he seek out Lan Xichen specifically to ask forgiveness, when he’s apologised for maybe five of the innumerable pranks he’s pulled since both of them were children? Why, after the raging, screaming argument in the lecture hall where they’d ripped each other to shreds?</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t know what to feel. On some level, he registers that Wei Wuxian <em>protected </em>him; that he humbled himself before his brother-in-law to say that the prank was <em>his</em> fault and Jiang Cheng had nothing to do with it.</p><p>But he can’t wrap his mind around it, can’t understand because Jiang Cheng had torn into him, had raged that he was selfish and immature and destroyed everything he touched. And Wei Wuxian had yelled back, called him heartless and a monster, and he’d been <em>right</em>. Didn’t that make Jiang Cheng wrong?</p><p>It’s always that way, isn’t it? One good and one bad, one right and one wrong, always and forever. If Wei Wuxian is right, then Jiang Cheng must be wrong. (It was usually that way when they were growing up. Yet sometimes Wei Wuxian was wrong, and that cheered Jiang Cheng up a bit because then he got to be right.)</p><p>Only one of them can be right; the other has to be wrong.</p><p>That knowledge was what fueled Jiang Cheng, kept him going all those years while Wei Wuxian’s body rotted in Luanzang-Gang. The pain and the death, the screams of the people he tortured – he blocked it all out and kept going, because Wei Wuxian had been wrong to choose demonic cultivation, and so Jiang Cheng was <em>right</em> to do what he was doing. To utterly obliterate everyone who followed in Wei Wuxian’s footsteps.</p><p>But now? Now Lan Xichen is in front of him, telling Jiang Cheng that he was right too, that Wei Wuxian had known it and <em>listened</em> to him. But that can’t be.</p><p>He startles when Lan Xichen’s voice cuts through his thoughts.</p><p>“–Wanyin? Sect Leader Jiang?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng blinks hazily. Oh, he thinks. Lan Xichen is addressing him. He sounds very concerned, almost worried. Then Jiang Cheng blinks again, more aggressively this time.</p><p>“I’m fine,” he says, in as gruff a tone as he can manage. “Just… thinking about something.”</p><p>The older man hums a little in response, but the troubled expression doesn’t go away. Still, he keeps silent, letting Jiang Cheng decide where the conversation should flow. Or if he even wants to talk at all.</p><p>A rush of gratitude fills him.</p><p>This consideration, this allowance for what <em>he</em> wants is something foreign to him. He’s so used to people barging in and steering the discussion to where they want it to go, or else sealing their mouths shut out of fear of what he might do if they speak out of turn. Jiang Cheng has never had someone <em>hand </em>him control just because they thought it might be more comfortable for him. Because he might want it.</p><p>He doesn’t speak for another full minute, too busy collecting his scattered thoughts. When he finally decides on something to say, he opens his mouth.</p><p>“Have you ever fought with your brother?”</p><p>Once the question is out, Jiang Cheng immediately wants to retract it. What kind of dumbass question is that? <em>Everyone </em>fights with their siblings. A good deal of Jiang Cheng’s childhood was characterized by him and Wei Wuxian constantly sniping at each other. When they were really young, he even had a couple arguments with <em>Ah-Jie</em> of all people, the most sweet-tempered person on the planet.</p><p>But Lan Xichen shakes his head.</p><p>“Not really. There are occasions on which we don’t see eye-to-eye, but we’ve never <em>fought</em>, per say.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s jaw drops. For a moment, he completely forgets about the hurricane of raw emotions swirling in his chest.</p><p>“You’re shitting me, right?”</p><p>He winces at the curse that flies out of his mouth. <em>Fuck</em>, he thinks. <em>That’s the first rule of propriety tossed right out the window. Just fantastic. </em>Jiang Cheng half-expects Lan Xichen to narrow his eyes, say “swearing is prohibited in Cloud Recesses”, and force Jiang Cheng to sit his ass down and copy Gusu’s four-thousand-and-some sect rules. But he doesn’t. Instead, he grins.</p><p>“I do not lie. As you may remember, telling untruths is prohibited in Cloud Recesses.”</p><p>Honestly, Jiang Cheng doesn’t know why he’s even surprised anymore. Lan Xichen is nothing like he’d expected him to be, even as they sat through war councils and years of boring sect gatherings together.</p><p>Then the other man continues, expression sobering. “The only time we’ve ever truly disagreed on something – the closest we’ve ever come to real conflict – was after the battle in Nightless City. Before Wangji fought and injured thirty-three of our clan elders.”</p><p><em>Because he was defending Wei Wuxian</em>. The words remain unspoken, but Jiang Cheng can hear them as clearly as if the older sect leader had shouted them. It always comes back to that, doesn’t it? To Jiang Cheng’s older brother, and the way knowing him upends the world.</p><p>“You were worried about him.” It’s not a question.</p><p>“I was. Still am, in fact. It’s one of the reasons we rarely argue: Wangji and I have a rather… unique relationship. We may be a few years apart, but people tend to see us as a single unit.”</p><p>“The Twin Jades of Gusu.”</p><p>“Exactly. Growing up, other than Shu-Fu, we only really had each other. Even when Wangji was a baby. I helped raise him – we’re very close.”</p><p>There’s a lump in Jiang Cheng’s throat. It hurts to swallow, the way it does in winter sometimes, before he spends the next week coughing his lungs up. He doesn’t want to say anything, but he <em>has</em> to. The need is right there, buried and itching under his skin, but he can’t scratch it out. Maybe if he just talks, it will go away.</p><p>He knows Lan Xichen will listen. He won’t change the subject or go quiet and unresponsive like his father, or tell him to shut up and quit whining like his mother used to.</p><p>
  <em>Ah-Niang, I’ve been trying. I’ve been trying so hard, but it’s not working. I’m so angry all the time, and I think it’s getting worse.</em>
</p><p>“We used to be, too. Before everything.”</p><p>He doesn’t say who ‘we’ is. He doesn’t need to.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has no idea how much the other man knows. The stories he told yesterday – Wei Wuxian had been in enough of them that he should have some idea of their relationship in their youth, and it’s not like it’s a secret that they grew up in the same household. Still, Jiang Cheng has never come out and said it explicitly.</p><p>He does now.</p><p>“Wei Wuxian was my brother – you know that. Everyone knows that. But he was also my best friend. Even though it was a long time ago, it’s–” Jiang Cheng searches for an appropriate word and comes up empty-handed. He’s never been good at expressing himself. “It’s a lot,” he finishes feebly.</p><p>He’s said almost nothing, yet Lan Xichen is nodding like he gets it, and suddenly Jiang Cheng realises that it’s not nothing at all. This is the most he’s opened up to anyone in <em>years</em>, and he’s not wrong. It’s a lot, and it leaves him feeling strung-out and hollow, as if the confession was physically ripped out of him.</p><p>But it’s a good kind of empty, like a bowl of poison that’s been poured away, and now he can finally be filled again. Maybe this time with something better.</p><p>“It is,” Lan Xichen says. “It’s a difficult situation, the one you’re in. The one both of you are in. It’s painful. But I think both of you are trying, and that counts for something. And it <em>will</em> improve. I have faith in you.”</p><p>Despite himself, Jiang Cheng feels the corners of his mouth twitch. It’s the first time someone’s ever said that to him.</p>

          <p>Today's chapter is a little bit heavy - there's a LOT of angst in here. Sorry about that. Also, I apologise if the characters are a little OOC in this. I know JC isn't really the type of person who would open up about his problems - which is why he doesn't say much, because he's out of practice - but I figured LXC is such a calming presence, he makes JC feel a little more at ease and a little more comfortable talking about his feelings.</p><p>Just to clarify: I do not in any way think that JC's thought processes are healthy. A lack of anger is not happiness, and it's okay to need other people. In fact, it is perfectly normal to want the people around you to care about and support you. The way JC is thinking in this chapter (throughout this fic, actually) is very unhealthy, and is the result of years of psychological damage and repressing his emotions. Also the fact that he's been flying solo since he was a teenager and had to rebuild his sect from the ground up himself. He loves Jin Ling and Jin Ling loves him back, but I'm pretty sure that the fifteen-year-old child one is raising is not an adequate support system. So, yeah, JC is kind of a mess. But he's getting better.</p><p>I hope that I am portraying these issues in a sensitive and at least mostly correct way. If not, I would love it if you would inform me, and I will edit immediately.</p>

    <p><em>It’s a lot</em>.</p>
<p>That is simultaneously the most vague and the truest thing Lan Huan has ever heard. It’s the same for him. The feeling that hits him sometimes, makes him think that too much has changed too fast. Often when it catches up to him, he can barely breathe, because it’s only been a year but really it’s been thirteen, and things aren’t the same as they used to be.</p>
<p>He’s not the same person he used to be.</p>
<p>Sometimes a new peony or carnation buds in the garden outside, and he forgets and thinks <em>Guangyao would be so excited to see this</em>. But then it all comes rushing back, and he suddenly remembers that Guangyao-who-loves-flowers is also Guangyao-who-led-their-first-sworn-brother-to-his-death, and Guangyao-who-murdered-his-own-five-year-old-son. Then the feeling crests over Lan Huan like a wave, and it’s nearly an hour before he can manage to flail far enough upwards to break the surface.</p>
<p>So Lan Huan gets it. Sometimes everything is a little too big, and you feel a little too small, like you’ll never be able to get past it all and move on, or even to swallow the fact that it happened in the first place. It’s overwhelming.</p>
<p>He’s never voiced this aloud, of course. He’s a sect leader – supposed to radiate strength and stability, not be an absolute mess of a human being. Wangji might get it, would probably understand, but his little brother has already been through so much and Lan Huan doesn’t want to burden him with his problems. It’s safer to keep them locked away inside of him, in a tiny cage with iron bars and the biggest padlock Lan Huan can find. Because then they can never get out and hurt anyone again, and Lan Huan can pretend that they’re not there at all.</p>
<p>(He’s always been a little too good at lying to himself.)</p>
<p>It’s easier too, to ignore his issues than to acknowledge their existence. And Lan Huan imagines that Jiang Wanyin is the same way.</p>
<p>The other man is just as scarred as he is, if not more. The crushing burden forced onto too-young shoulders, the stabbing pain of the betrayal of a brother and the hollowness of losing loved ones – Lan Huan is familiar with it all. And so is Jiang Wanyin. But he has never had what Lan Huan has. A brother and an uncle, remnants of the family destroyed when his sect burned, but family nonetheless.</p>
<p>All Jiang Wanyin has are ashes, and the child he raised on his own.</p>
<p>He is angry, always – that much Lan Huan can see. His temper is legendary, as much a weapon as his famed whip Zidian, or his sword Sandu. It is enough for people to fear him, to clasp their hands together when Jiang Wanyin’s name is mentioned and pray that they never cross him.</p>
<p>Lan Huan was never one of those people (cowardice, too, is prohibited in Cloud Recesses). But Jiang Wanyin is right in front of him, and that fiery, incandescent rage that is one of his defining characteristics is gone. Snuffed out, like a candle flame that has burned too far down the wick.</p>
<p>And behind the anger, behind the scowls and snarls and the threatening crackle of violet lightning, the other man is vulnerable. He is tired, overwhelmed; he <em>feels too much</em>, and for the first time, Lan Huan realises something that the people who are terrified of him will never know.</p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin’s fury is a mask. A hard, thorny, impenetrable shield that he puts up so no one will ask questions. So all everyone sees is the wrathful sect leader, and no one will ever look closer to get a glimpse of the frightened, grieving little boy inside. But it is also more than a disguise. Because he has been wearing it so long that it has sunk into his skin, seeped into his blood and now it pulses in time with his heart. It is part of him, and he cannot take it off.</p>
<p>Lan Huan knows, because this is the story of his smile.</p>
<p>But somehow, some way, there is a crack in Jiang Wanyin’s mask. Made perhaps by his brother, or by the man himself. (Lan Huan isn’t egotistical enough to presume that it might be <em>him</em>.) The crack runs deeper than the skin, all the way down to the bone, and Jiang Wanyin has <em>shown it to Lan Huan</em>.</p>
<p>The younger sect leader is caustic and prickly, a tiger with a sore tooth that roars at anything that moves; but now the tiger has opened its mouth so that Lan Huan can see and understand. Lan Huan might just be a little awed, because such an action is brave and trusting and so much more than he deserves.</p>
<p>So when he tells Jiang Wanyin that he has faith in him, it’s only the least he can do. Even though his heart beats faster and louder in his chest at the other man’s answering expression, the corners of his mouth quirked upwards in something that would be a grin on anyone else.</p>
<p>And when they finally say goodbye at the edge of Lan Huan’s garden, as he waves and Jiang Wanyin turns to disappear back into the maze of corridors, of course Lan Huan’s smile is brighter and more genuine than it has been in over a year. It’s only right, after all.</p>
<p> </p><hr/>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jiang Cheng is already halfway back to his own quarters when it registers in his stupid, vegetable-mush mind that he’s still wearing Lan Xichen’s robes. If he even has a mind, that is, since he’s obviously fucking <em>brain dead</em>.</p>
<p>He’s had on three layers of another man’s clothes for almost an hour now, and yeah, they’re kind of weirdly comfortable, in a billowy, swishy way. But not so much so that Jiang Cheng would fucking <em>forget</em> to change out before he left.</p>
<p>Instead, he’s standing alone in a deserted corridor, gussied up like some prissy little Gusu Lan disciple. All he’s missing is the damn forehead ribbon. To make matters worse, his own (perfectly comfortable, thank you very much) Yunmeng Jiang sect robes are sitting in a pile in Lan Xichen’s tiny bathroom, and Jiang Cheng’s dumb ass has <em>also</em> forgotten to tie his hair.</p>
<p>In short, he looks like Wei Wuxian when Lan Wangji has gotten him up too early after staying up too late, and <em>fuck</em> that is so not a thing he needs to be thinking about right now. Gods, he’s doing the walk of shame without even having gotten laid. What a nightmare.</p>
<p>This is all Lan Xichen’s fault, he thinks sourly. But it’s not – not really. The other sect leader has been in seclusion for a year, cut off from all human contact except for his brother and probably his uncle. Who are both Lan sect members. Not to mention that this is his home turf. He’s undoubtedly used to seeing white robes with fucking cloud patterns left and right, and it’s Jiang Cheng who’s the weird one for wearing fucking <em>purple</em>.</p>
<p>He deflates a bit. <em>Gods damn it</em>. Jiang Cheng’s to blame, isn’t he? He’s messed up big this time.</p>
<p>Irritated with himself, Jiang Cheng twists his ring around his finger. <em>Quit the pity party and man the hell up</em>, he thinks. <em>You’re the one who dove headfirst into this steaming garbage heap; now get yourself out.</em></p>
<p>The way he sees it, he has two options. One: turn around right now, before anyone else can see him standing here looking like an idiot, and head back the way he came. Knock on Lan Xichen’s door and says “hey, you know I only left about five minutes ago, but I’m back now, because I left my clothes in your sink and I don’t really want to walk back and have people look at me like I slept with someone I shouldn’t have”. All while he tries not to keel over from embarrassment – for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe Jiang Cheng only has one option. Which is: to shore up the last remaining vestiges of his dignity, grit his teeth and just waltz back into his rooms like nothing is wrong. Perhaps not <em>exactly</em> like that – he’s likely going to have to do some fancy maneuvering to make sure nobody sees him (or, failing that, recognizes him), but he can pull it off. Probably.</p>
<p>But once he’s done that, he’ll be home free. The gathering was scheduled to last a week, and Jiang Cheng had enough foresight to remember to bring a few changes of clothes. Then he can return to the little cottage tomorrow – when it’ll be less awkward – to give his report and pick up his robes.</p>
<p>And anyway, it’s only good manners to wash the things you borrow from other people. He can return Lan Xichen’s robes tomorrow, too.</p>
<p>The longer Jiang Cheng reasons with himself, the more convinced he is that this is a good idea. Possible loss of face in front of a few Lan disciples he can cow into silence with a few well-placed glares versus certain humiliation in front of the Lan sect leader? No contest.</p>
<p>Possible humiliation it is.</p>
<p>His mind made up, Jiang Cheng sets off in the direction of his assigned rooms. This is going to go perfectly well, he assures himself. No humiliation, possible or otherwise, will be necessary.</p>
<p><em>You fucking coward</em>, a tiny – but rather vocal – part of his mind hisses mutinously. <em>You’re just afraid of making yourself look stupid in front of the only friend you’ve managed to make in over thirty years.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, that’s my business, isn’t it?</em> Jiang Cheng shoots back. <em>Shut your trap if you don’t have anything constructive to say.</em></p>
<p>(He will neither confirm nor deny the pathetic little warmth that maybe-blossoms in his chest at the admission that even the angrier parts of him think of Lan Xichen as his friend.)</p>
<p>He’s back in the main section of Cloud Recesses now. There are buildings on either side, rather than the blank white walls of the corridors. Thankfully, there are few people milling around, and even fewer actually walking to a destination. A few disciples stroll past, a mix of different sects, but Jiang Cheng isn’t paying attention to the colour of their robes as he darts behind the nearest wall.</p>
<p>Gods, he feels ridiculous. He’s not conducting <em>espionage</em>, for heaven’s sake, simply trying to avoid a potentially inconvenient – and very, very awkward – situation.</p>
<p>When the kids are a safe distance away, Jiang Cheng continues along the path to the sect leaders’ quarters. There are no other obstacles in his way. Once or twice, he catches a glimpse of black fabric out of the corner of his eye. A flash of red. But when he turns to look, it’s gone, and Jiang Cheng is left feeling as though he’s missing something. Some sort of puzzle piece crucial to an understanding.</p>
<p>Finally, he reaches his destination: the short, white building he’s been living in for the past three days. He’s never been more relieved to get indoors in his life as he is as he slips through the front doors and into the long hallway.</p>
<p>Jiang Cheng counts the doors as he passes by them. His room is the seventh, a good number.</p>
<p>
  <em>…five… six… sev–</em>
</p>
<p>His mental countdown is cut short when the eighth door – Jin Ling’s room, he realises, too late – opens and the sounds of boyish laughter fill the air. Three teenagers pile into the hallway, which is too small for the sheer amount of <em>space</em> that more-or-less seventeen-year-olds take up. Not to mention one very shell-shocked adult.</p>
<p><em>Fuck</em>, Jiang Cheng thinks, reaching for his door so he can throw himself inside before the kids can process that he’s there. Unfortunately, that’s not what happens.</p>
<p>“Sect Leader Jiang!”, two voices chorus at the same time. One bubbly and excited, almost shouting, the other more reserved.</p>
<p>“Uncle!”, another says, just a beat slower, surprise evident in the tone. Great. It’s Lan Jingyi, Lan Sizhui, and, oh joy of joys, his nephew. And all of them, every single one, is looking at Jiang Cheng with an expression of complete mystification. As if he’s just told them that the earth is flat and they’re standing on the edge.</p>
<p>Jin Ling is the first to break the momentary silence.</p>
<p>“What are you <em>wearing</em>?”</p>

    <p>This is an unmitigated disaster, Jiang Cheng thinks as he stares at the three kids in front of him in dawning horror. His smart-assed brat of a nephew, the Gusu Lan sect’s darling and it’s resident troublemaker, all gathered together to bear witness to one of Jiang Cheng’s most spectacular fuck-ups in recent history.</p><p>This is <em>infinitely</em> worse than getting caught by a couple of no-name disciples he could have threatened with death and dismemberment in exchange for silence. In fact, these three idiots – they’re everywhere these days, gods damn it – are probably the worst people who could have stumbled upon him in his disheveled, improperly dressed state.</p><p>Except for Hanguang-Jun, that is. But then, on second thought, the other man would probably just fix him with a <em>look</em> that’s too polite to be a glower, turn on his heel and go off in the other direction to find his husband.</p><p>So maybe Jiang Cheng’s initial assessment of the situation was correct and he’s as massively screwed as it is possible for him to be. And so close to being home free, too. He really does have the shittiest luck.</p><p>All of this flashes through his mind in the time it takes for Lan Jingyi to open his big mouth and worsen the situation to the tenth degree.</p><p>“Those are <em>our</em> sect’s robes,” he gasps, and Jin Ling’s expression briefly shifts to his ‘<em>no shit, dumbass</em>’ face before reverting to his current favourite mode, which appears to be ‘<em>what the actual fuck?</em>’ Then the Lan sect disciple’s eyes widen. “Those are <em>Zewu-Jun’s</em> robes!”</p><p>The exclamation comes out in a near shriek, and Jiang Cheng wonders how long it would take him to dig a hole big enough to curl up and die in, and if it would be possible to do that <em>before</em> he spontaneously combusts from embarrassment. Of course Sect Leader Lan’s robes would be instantly recognizable to any cultivator from his sect, and <em>of fucking course</em> Jiang Cheng just happens to be stuck in a crowded hallway with two of them. One of who has all the self-awareness of a dung beetle in the middle of lunch.</p><p>You know, up until this moment, Jiang Cheng used to kind of like Lan Jingyi. Mainly because he was funny and routinely pissed Lan Qiren off so much he spat blood. Jiang Cheng could totally get behind that. Now, well, Jiang Cheng never thought that he’d actually agree with Old Man Lan on anything, but Lan Jingyi is a devil child. A menace to society.</p><p>Lan Sizhui, on the other hand, is simply wearing an expression of mild surprise. This is all new information to Jin Ling, though, and the kid’s eyes just about bug out of his head.</p><p>Shit. Jiang Cheng was a teenager himself not that long ago – he knows how their minds work. Their creative, filthy little minds that without fail manage to find the worst, most dramatic explanations for all but the simplest of things.</p><p>And Jiang Cheng is just standing here like a deer that knows it’s about to be shot at, with the look of absolute guilt plastered all over his face, his fucking hair down and <em>wearing someone else’s clothes.</em></p><p>He panics. Of course he panics. It’s completely justifiable. Anyone would in this situation.</p><p>But for <em>anyone</em>, panicking would entail rushed apologies and a stream of garbled nonsense, interspersed with “please, I can explain” and “this is not what it looks like”. It would mean an ice-cold spike between their ribs and a tight feeling in their chest as their mind runs through each and every thing that could go wrong and at least eight different worst-case scenarios.</p><p>For Jiang Cheng, that’s not the case. Oh, he feels the latter, all right; he’s just as paranoid as the next guy. But the former? Never. Jiang Cheng just doesn’t do sheepish and timid, or bashfully contrite. It’s not in his repertoire of personality traits.</p><p>What he does get, however, is angry.</p><p>It’s not the kind of blood-boiling fury that swallows him sometimes, that hazes his vision and tints it red, makes his fingers itch for Zidian. No – this is thinner, more brittle. Just a little sharper and tinged with mania, because it’s not a whole emotion; just a suit of armour that fits over the bits of him that are freaking the fuck out and makes it out like he’s losing his temper instead of his sanity.</p><p>“Mind your own goddamn business,” he snaps irritably. “There is nothing going on between Sect Leader Lan and myself. Nothing at all. And even if there was, it is none of your concern – <em>any </em>of your concern. Do I make myself clear?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng can feel the fire in his eyes blazing brighter as he talks, his words barbed and landing with the sound of Zidian cracking against bare skin. The three junior disciples seem to pick up on the animosity in his voice, shrinking a little. Even Jin Ling edges back a fraction of a step.</p><p>Lan Jingyi has gone pale, his lips pressed together, tight and colourless. Jiang Cheng notes with a petty sense of satisfaction that the calm on Lan Sizhui’s face is more forced than usual.</p><p><em>You think you can make </em>me <em>uncomfortable, you little shits? I’ve been threatening people for longer than any of you have been alive.</em></p><p>All three of them nod, even though Jin Ling’s is a beat slower than the other two.</p><p>“Uncle–“, he tries, but Jiang Cheng silences him with a glare.</p><p>“None of you will speak a word about <em>any</em> of this, to <em>anyone</em>. Not to your classmates, and especially not to your <em>illustrious</em> Hanguang-Jun.” He spits out the last three words like an insult. “If I hear so much as a whisper, I will make your lives very, very unpleasant.”</p><p>More frantic nodding. Lan Jingyi looks a bit like a chicken with his head bobbing up and down like that, Jiang Cheng notes with a hint of amusement. He takes a step forward.</p><p>In unison, the kids shuffle backwards. Jiang Cheng doesn’t think they even notice that they’re doing it.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Before he can take in the identical expressions of pure relief on their faces, Jiang Cheng stalks back to the door of his own room, pulls it open and then slams it shut behind him. Outside, in the hallway, there is silence. Then, a couple seconds later, the sound of three pairs of feet shuttling off down the hallway, footsteps becoming fainter and fainter.</p><p>Just as quickly as it came, Jiang Cheng’s anger evaporates. His knees go weak, and he slumps against the wooden door, his breaths coming quick and hard, as though he’s just run from one end of Cloud Recesses to the other.</p><p>Now that the rage is gone, the anxiety simmering underneath it is allowed free rein. The chill of it seeps into his bones, spreading into every nook and cranny of his mind. His stomach sinks.</p><p><em>Oh, for the love of Rulai-Fo</em>, he thinks wildly, his inner voice coloured with faint hysteria. Without the presence of the three teenagers, the logical part of his mind has time to run through the entire conversation, and is slowly coming to the conclusion that he has dug a nice, big hole for himself indeed. Jiang Cheng is royally fucked.</p><p>Because just now, while he was too riled-up to think straight and just blurted out whatever popped into his brain based on instinct, Jiang Cheng acted nothing but defensive. Accusatory. And everyone knows that when someone responds to a question with defensiveness and accusations, they’re probably lying. Or at least have something to hide.</p><p><em>Nice going, idiot</em>. He’s just offered himself up as cannon fodder, hasn’t he?</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s only when they’re out of both eyeshot and earshot of Jin Ling’s uncle, the three of them tucked away in a remote little corner, sitting beneath Sizhui’s favourite willow tree, that they finally feel safe enough to let out a collective sigh of relief. Jingyi huffs and sprawls out on the neatly cut grass, body half-in-half-out of the shade of the willow tree.</p><p>“I thought we were going to die,” he says dramatically, the back of his hand pressed against his forehead as though he’s about to swoon like one of the maidens in those romance novels Wei Wuxian likes so much. “I thought he was going to taser us with Zidian and throw our corpses down the mountain, where we’d roll into the river and no one would ever find us.”</p><p>“Oh, be quiet, will you?”</p><p>Jin Ling snorts, even as his own stomach quivers with remembered dread, still tied up in knots. He hasn’t been afraid of his uncle in years – not since he figured out that the older man never actually followed through on his threats to break Jin Ling’s legs slowly and painfully – but the look in his eyes, the deadly edge to his voice, had scared Jin Ling shitless. Triggered every single one of Jin Ling’s instincts to scream <em>sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up</em>.</p><p>“Oh, of course the <em>Young Mistress</em> isn’t scared. He’s your uncle! He’s not going to disembowel <em>you</em>. Me, on the other hand–”</p><p>Jin Ling interrupts.</p><p>“Sizhui was there too, and you don’t see <em>him</em> complaining, you little sissy.”</p><p>“Excuse me, but have you forgotten who Sizhui’s parents are? <em>Hanguang-Jun and the Yiling Patriarch?</em> Ring a bell? Both of you were safe, and you know it. <em>I’m</em> just a nobody disciple; if one of us were to end up gutted and floating lifeless down the river, I’m the obvious choice. I have a right to be terrified, thank you very much.”</p><p>Jin Ling gears up to fire off another scathing retort, but before he can open his mouth, Sizhui’s familiar deep voice cuts in.</p><p>“Please calm down, both of you,” he says. Though he sounds exasperated at their bickering, Jin Ling can see the fond warmth in his eyes. It sends a little thrill through him, and for once, Jin Ling doesn’t care that that makes him sound girly.</p><p>But of course, the moment doesn’t last long before Jingyi senses an opportunity to change the topic, and leaps headlong after it. As per fucking usual. A devious light comes into his eyes, and for a moment, Jin Ling’s friend resembles nothing so much as a mischievous forest imp, the kind that likes to play tricks and steal people’s underwear when they’re not paying attention. (Don’t ask.)</p><p>“Do you think there’s something going on with Sect Leader Jiang and Zewu-Jun?”, he asks, eyes wide and innocent, even though he knows very well what’s about to happen.</p><p>Right on cue, Sizhui gives him a reproving look. “Jingyi, it’s rude to talk about others behind their backs. Besides, it’s against the sect rules.”</p><p>The other boy pouts, and Jin Ling is reminded for a second that he really, <em>really</em> loves his boyfriend. Though he should have expected that wouldn’t keep Jingyi quiet for long. Nothing can, once the idiot gets going. And for some reason, he’s warmed to the topic of Jin Ling’s uncle.</p><p>“But you guys all saw it too, right? I wasn’t imagining the entire thing? Sect Leader Jiang was really-actually-for-sure wearing Zewu-Jun’s clothes?”</p><p>Jin Ling can feel his face getting hot on his uncle’s behalf. “What about it?”, he counters defensively, even though he was wondering much the same.</p><p>“Hah! I knew it! It <em>was </em>real!” Jingyi pumps his fist in the air, looking triumphant, and, Jin Ling thinks, a little ridiculous. Then he frowns and turns to Sizhui. “Hey, you’re the smartest. What are the odds of a collective hallucination?”</p><p>“Don’t talk shit about my uncle!”</p><p>The other boy raises his hands in a placating gesture. “Relax, I wasn’t doing anything like that. It’s just – I don’t know, don’t you find it a little strange? His hair was <em>down</em>, Jin Ling. That’s, like, impossible or something. Or at least unheard-of. Just saying, but no one shows up in someone else’s clothes unless they were doing <em>something</em>.”</p><p>All three of them go silent for a moment, considering what <em>something</em> might mean. Jin Ling shudders.</p><p>“Fuck you, Jingyi. I did <em>not</em> need that mental image.”</p><p>Bless his pure, pure soul; Sizhui puts a sympathetic arm around Jin Ling from where he’s sitting, leaning against the tree trunk. Jin Ling scoots closer so his back is pressed against his boyfriend’s chest and he’s practically sitting in the older boy’s lap.</p><p>Jingyi rolls his eyes, obviously bitter about being the third wheel in their little trio. Then his mouth pulls into a wicked grin. “You know, Jin Ling, your uncle’s actually kind of hot.”</p><p>“Go on, say that to his face, I dare you.”</p><p>“No can do, my flowery friend. I like my head just fine where it is, thanks.” Jin Ling scowls at the jab at his sect robes, and the peony embroidered on the front. “Seriously, though, has Sect Leader Jiang been acting any different lately? Like, anything that could be attributed to… you know.”</p><p>The young heir to the Lanling Jin sect folds his arms in front of his chest. “I don’t see why you’re so interested in my uncle’s social life.” He absolutely refuses to call if a love life. No. Just, no. But Jingyi is giving him that pleading look that makes him look like an excited puppy begging for a treat, and Jin Ling is weak for that face. He can feel Sizhui against him, practically vibrating with curiosity as well, just too polite to voice it. Jin Ling relents.</p><p>“I wouldn’t call it different, exactly, but he started visiting Sect Leader Lan a couple days ago, when we first got here. Giving reports on meetings and stuff like that. Since then, he’s – I don’t know – he’s been a little less angry? He doesn’t yell as much, I guess?” Now that Jingyi’s mentioned it, there has been a steep decline in threats to the bones in Jin Ling’s legs these past few days, but he’d chalked it up to a general improvement in mood.</p><p>Suddenly, though, he finds himself wondering what could have caused that. Damn it. He’s been spending too much time with Jingyi, if he’s getting to be this nosy.</p><p>“You think it has something to do with Zewu-Jun?”, Jin Ling asks. Rather rhetorically – he knows where Jingyi stands on the matter. Said Lan disciple hums, suddenly thoughtful.</p><p>“I didn’t take Sect Leader Jiang for someone who would be interested in men.”</p><p>“It does seem to run in the family,” comments Sizhui. Jin Ling rounds on him. Fucking traitor.</p><p>“I thought you were supposed to be on <em>my</em> side,” he says, outraged.</p><p>His boyfriend tugs lightly on the ends of his ponytail. “Just looking at all the facts.” Unbelievable. (And entirely too reasonable.)</p><p>Jingyi reaches over from where he’s lying undignified across the grass, and flicks the tip of Jin Ling’s nose before he can dodge. “Just look at it this way, Young Mistress. Sect Leader Jiang spends more time with Zewu-Jun, he gets happier. He gets happier, you suffer less. Everyone wins, see? And as a bonus, you get a new uncle.”</p><p>Jin Ling doesn’t even try to suppress the indignant wail that escapes him at that utterly bone-headed logic. “I don’t need a new fucking uncle! I already have three!”</p><p>“You have to admit, there are far worse choices. I love Hanguang-Jun and all, but Zewu-Jun is like, the nicest person on the planet. No offense to your dad, Sizhui.”</p><p>“None taken.”</p><p>“Anyway, the point is: you’ve kind of hit the jackpot with this whole thing. I say you shouldn’t look this gift donkey in the mouth; get them together as soon as possible. Official dating, wedding, cultivation partnership – the whole ball of wax. But don’t panic, we’re only too happy to be of assistance.”</p><p>Jingyi rubs his hands together gleefully, a manic look on his face that Jin Ling has come to know means he’s plotting something. Jin Ling’s stomach sinks, but he doesn’t have the energy to argue. He turns to Sizhui instead.</p><p>“Are you hearing this?”</p><p>Sizhui smiles helplessly. A single dimple appears in his right cheek, and just like that, Jin Ling knows it’s over. He’s not going to win this one. But he’s got to make it look like he tried, at least.</p><p>“Really? I thought you were terrified of my uncle. Now you’re going along with Jingyi’s insane plan to get him hitched to yours?”</p><p>“I’m still terrified of him,” Sizhui admits. “But yes.”</p><p>Jin Ling buries his face in his hands. Well, he put up a good fight. “You’re a great help. Really useful. Thank you.”</p><p>It’s as good as a white flag, and Jingyi grins at his victory. He sits up, back suddenly ruler-straight in the impeccable posture Lan Qiren has been trying for <em>eons</em> to drill into his thick skull. Lowers his voice to a whisper so Jin Ling and Sizhui have to lean in to hear it.</p><p>“Here’s the plan…”</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Jiang Cheng spends the rest of the day doing paperwork and feeling sorry for himself. It’s mindless work, and for once, he’s grateful for the monotony of filling out forms and putting his signature down on what seems like every piece of paper in Lotus Pier. It keeps his mind off his latest monumental fuck-up, and how he’s undoubtedly going to suffer for it later, if he knows Jin Ling at all. (And he <em>does</em>; he raised the brat. Unfortunately.)</p><p>When the pile of bureaucratic bullshit on his desk finally dwindles away to nothing, he rises. Stretches out the kinks in his neck, and begins to take off the robes that started this whole mess in the first place.</p><p>The outermost layer comes off first – the flappiest one, not secured by the belt, then the middle layer with its blue cloud designs – the one that gives the Gusu Lan uniform its characteristic look. The inner robe is warmer, made out of a thicker material to withstand the perpetual chill that comes with building one’s sect at the top of a fucking mountain.</p><p>Jiang Cheng makes a mental note to have all the robes washed later, and drapes them over the back of a chair so he won’t forget. For the first time, he notices that the cloth smells different from his own clothes. Instead of the familiar scent of the lotus soap that is used in Yunmeng, Zewu-Jun’s robes smell of rosemary and sage. The herbs that Lan Xichen grows in his cottage, dangling from the kitchen ceiling in little wicker baskets.</p><p>It’s different, a little strange, but not in a bad way.</p><p>Then Jiang Cheng realises that he’s been standing in his room for the past ten minutes, wearing nothing but his under-clothes and staring into space, yards of pristine white cloth crumpled in his hands. He lets go abruptly, as if dropping a hot coal, and jumps back, a heat in his cheeks that he’s glad no one is here to see.</p><p>It’s the lack of sleep, he tells himself firmly. He hasn’t been sleeping well lately, and it’s making him act like an empty-headed dunce.</p><p>Jiang Cheng puts on his own clothes, and resolutely ignores the little part of him that’s laughing at him hysterically, because Jiang Cheng hasn’t slept well in <em>years</em>.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The night – and the morning that follows – goes pretty predictably, in the scheme of things.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has a nightmare, wakes up from the throes of said nightmare, then heads down to the empty courtyard to take his frustrations out on practice dummies and imaginary enemies. After that, he returns to his rooms, makes himself presentable, and then rousts Jin Ling from his usual teenager pseudo-coma to get ready in time for today’s meeting.</p><p>It’s all very… mundane. It should unsettle him, how easy it’s been for him to fall into a routine here, the way he has back at Lotus Pier. How similar it all feels. Yunmeng is his <em>home</em>, has been since he was born, since he watched it burn down to ashes and smouldering ruins, then built it up anew to a shining city with his own two hands, watered it with his own blood and sweat and tears. Yunmeng is all of what Jiang Cheng is; how, then, is there so little of him in it?</p><p>But it doesn’t matter, not really. As long as he keeps his sect running smoothly, nothing matters.</p><p>As Jiang Cheng hears his nephew clattering about in his room, he pushes those thoughts to the back of his mind. He’s going to need all his wits about him for the day ahead. Today’s meeting is undoubtedly going to be taxing, and after yesterday’s clothing debacle, he’ll have to be on guard to disable any rumours floating around.</p><p>A cold feeling knots in his stomach at the thought. Jin Ling would never willingly do anything to harm him, and Lan Sizhui is the type to keep his mouth shut when speech is unwarranted. It’s Lan Jingyi who’s the wild card here. The kid is a loudmouth, and that’s enough to set Jiang Cheng on edge, but he’s also accustomed to getting into trouble and hiding it. It could blow either way, to be honest, and that’s what he doesn’t like.</p><p>Unpredictability is one of his pet peeves – right in the top spot on the list, as it so happens. Just ahead of insubordination and public displays of affection. Jiang Cheng fucking <em>hates</em> when things are out of his control. Especially a ‘thing’ this important.</p><p>If Lan Jingyi blabs about what happened yesterday, speculation would spread like wildfire. Jiang Cheng knows how quickly people jump to conclusions, rushing to outdo each other by coming up with the most outlandish, most improbable explanations and conjectures. Everything would go haywire before he could clear it up by explaining that the whole thing was a misunderstanding, and by then, it would already be out of control. The damage would already be done.</p><p>Everyone who knows Jiang Cheng also knows that he cares quite a bit – no, a lot, actually – about his own reputation, which would assuredly take a beating from the incident. But more than that, he’s not the only person it would affect, and somehow, that makes it even worse. Affairs are all too common in the cultivation world – one needs to look no further than Jin Guangshan, the dearly departed asshole, for proof of that – but one involving two <em>men</em>? Two sect leaders, no less, of two of the four great sects?</p><p>It would be ruinous. The scandal alone would turn both their clans inside out. Lan Xichen’s name would be dragged through the mud. His uncle would be furious with him – not one, but <em>both</em> of the twin Jades of the Lan sect?</p><p>Never mind that nothing even happened. Never mind that Jiang Cheng doesn’t even <em>like</em> men in that way, and he’s pretty sure Lan Xichen is the same. All the masses care about is feeding their wild imaginations and starving curiosities, never mind that they’re ruining the lives of actual people. Just like fourteen years ago–</p><p>A knock on his door snaps Jiang Cheng out of the panicked spiral of his thoughts. He suddenly realises that he’s sitting on his bed, his hands twisted together so tight he can barely feel them, Zidian somehow worked off his finger and gripped between his thumbs and forefingers as though it’s a prayer object. Offered up in exchange for – in exchange for what? Peace of mind?</p><p>He nearly scoffs at that. Jams the ring back onto his right hand where it belongs, barks out an “I’m coming!” and sweeps out of the room.</p><p>Jin Ling is waiting for him in the hallway, hair tied up the way Jiang Cheng taught him when he was five years old, his arms folded across his chest. Looking every inch the young mistress that Lan Jingyi teases him for being. Both of them are quiet on the way down to the pavilion, Jin Ling’s expression calm and unruffled as Jiang Cheng has never seen it. It must be Lan Sizhui’s influence.</p><p>Despite that, however, there is a distinct air of smugness that hangs over Jin Ling like a cloud. Jiang Cheng can feel it radiating off him in waves, though it shows neither in the kid’s face face, nor in his body language.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>, he thinks, because he remembers this. Jin Ling gets it from his father. Back when they were still children, still young and innocent and ignorant, Wei Wuxian used to pull the most outrageous pranks on Jin Zixuan, sending him off into red-faced, spitting fits of rage. But afterwards, when Jiang Cheng’s older brother was off doing his (admittedly well-deserved) time in the discipline room with Lan Wangji, the golden peacock would strut around for <em>days</em>, practically reeking of victory. Though his face was always fixed in a perfect mask of piety and humility.</p><p>It seems to be a trait of Lanling Jin sect members, unfortunately. And Jiang Cheng is pretty sure that this time, it’s directed at him. <em>Fuck</em>, he thinks again. Something’s going to go wrong. Something always goes wrong.</p><p>But as the two of them walk through the corridors of Cloud Recesses, no one turns to whisper when they pass. There are no hissed gasps, wide eyes or gaping jaws, only the usual hum of conversation between cultivators and disciples. No one side-eyes Jiang Cheng suspiciously; they simply give a nod and a small polite bow, and continue on their merry way.</p><p>Jiang Cheng feels himself relax a little. Apparently, news of yesterday’s incident has not, in fact, been spread all over Cloud Recesses. Which means that Lan Jingyi hasn’t sold him out, and probably won’t in the near future.</p><p>Praise the gods. The relief is nearly tangible, but Jiang Cheng doesn’t let it show. No need to clue anyone in that anything out of the ordinary has taken place. <em>I swear</em>, he promises himself, <em>I will not do anything that stupid ever again.</em></p><p>It’s a foolish pledge, he knows. Jiang Cheng has always told himself not to make vows that he can’t fulfill, and if there’s something he’s good at, it’s making poor decisions. His whole life is basically a testament to that. But it doesn’t mean he isn’t going to try.</p><p>He and Jin Ling near the pavilion. They’re slightly early today, so few people are here, milling outside the structure. The ones that are present are already seated inside, waiting for the gathering to begin.</p><p>Jiang Cheng spots a familiar silhouette by the door. Tall, dressed in white, his head canted to the side as he talks to someone, and for a moment, Jiang Cheng’s faulty heart leaps in his chest before he remembers that Lan Xichen is in seclusion, and this is his brother, Lan Wangji. Who conveniently hates Jiang Cheng’s guts.</p><p>The Yunmeng Jiang sect leader draws closer, Jin Ling beside him, and finally makes out who it is that is speaking with Hanguang-Jun. Wei Wuxian.</p><p>The shorter man is pressed up against Lan Wangji’s much taller frame, hanging off his arm as the two of them whisper to each other. They look like <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em>; the Yiling Patriarch’s black robes next to the Lan Second Jade’s white ones, a pair of young lovers wrapped up in each other’s existence. Wei Wuxian is looking at Hanguang-Jun like he is his entire world, as though nothing is real aside from the man in front of him.</p><p>For a moment, the split second that Jiang Cheng witnesses this, standing in broad daylight in a place he was invited to, he feels like an intruder. A thief breaking into someone’s home to steal something he has no right to.</p><p>But then Wei Wuxian looks up, and the moment is over. He pries himself away from his husband – a brief look of displeasure flashes over Hanguang-Jun’s blank face as the two of them break apart – gives a shallow bow, and vanishes. Just like that. He steps into a little patch of shadow, and suddenly he is gone, leaving the three of them standing there, staring at nothing.</p><p>Lan Wangji grunts softly and moves away, and Jin Ling glances up at his uncle.</p><p>“What was that?”, he asks, as though Jiang Cheng is supposed to know how his older brother’s mind works. As though he’s supposed to be able to fucking <em>read</em> him.</p><p>Instead of responding, Jiang Cheng strides into the pavilion and sits down. Jin Ling has no choice but to follow suit. He asks again, and this time, Jiang Cheng tells him to be quiet.</p><p>He understands now, what that was. How Wei Wuxian looked up and met his eyes, and that was all he needed to break away and disappear as though he had never been there at all. Jiang Cheng has known the other man since they were both ten years old, has seen him walk and stagger and sprint, seen him sway side to side and stagger drunkenly. He’s watched Wei Wuxian run aimlessly without direction, run towards something and away from something.</p><p>And now, Wei Wuxian is running away from him.</p>

    <p>For the next three hours, Jiang Cheng does his best to focus on the meeting. It’s not bad, not like it was on the second day they were here. Now that they’ve laid out the groundwork, things go much more smoothly, especially with the suggestion that Jin Ling made yesterday.</p><p>The sect leaders are actually agreeing with each other, and for once, no one looks like they want to kill anyone else. Of course, there’s Sect Leader Kun, who always looks like he wants to kill someone. He doesn’t really count, since he barely talks anyway and prefers to keep his threats silent, so he’s easy to ignore. Nie Huaisang is relatively subdued today, the reason for which, Jiang Cheng thinks, is pretty fucking obvious. It’s not every day that an established sect leader gets shut down by a sixteen-year-old in a room full of his colleagues.</p><p>It’s also really damn embarrassing. At least on Nie Huaisang’s side. Jiang Cheng can’t bring himself to feel pity though, because it was his nephew on the contributing end of the smackdown.</p><p>All in all, it’s good. The twenty of them select the representatives for the Council – as the others have taken to calling it – and each sect’s candidate meets with approval from the rest. They then set times, dates and venues for them to meet on a biweekly basis.</p><p>By the time the gong sounds for the end of the meeting, Jiang Cheng has convinced himself that he’s managed to forget the awful way his stomach clenched earlier, when he’d realised Wei Wuxian was avoiding him. He tunes out the voice that reminds him that they haven’t spoken since the argument, and maybe all the progress they’ve made in repairing their relationship over the past year has gone to naught, and they’ll never speak to each other again.</p><p>It’s no less than Jiang Cheng deserves.</p><p>It’s then that Jin Ling makes a move to leave, and Jiang Cheng has to call after him to stop before he runs off and disappears. The kid can go anywhere he wants, but Jiang Cheng wants his nephew back before dinner. He’s been putting it off for far too long, what with so many unexpected <em>things</em> cropping up left and right, but he needs to talk to Jin Ling properly, one-to-one without his friends around.</p><p>They do this all the time, back at home in Lotus Pier. Eat together so that Jiang Cheng can check on Jin Ling’s progress in his studies and cultivation. Lately, due to the daily meetings, they haven’t seen each other as much, what with Jin Ling constantly disappearing with Lan Sizhui and all.</p><p>Jiang Cheng is partly to blame as well, he supposes. His stomach twinges a little in guilt at the thought that he’s neglecting his nephew, and he resolves to spend more time with the kid. Even if he has to drag him away from his boyfriend to do it.</p><p>Jin Ling agrees hurriedly and, as per Jiang Cheng’s expectations, vanishes practically into thin air. The older man sighs. <em>Teenagers</em>. He doesn’t remember ever being like that when he was that age – he spent nearly all his free time training and studying, trying to get his cultivation level up so he could be as good or <em>better</em> than everyone else. The remainder of his leisure hours was usually spent attempting to talk Wei Wuxian out of his more… daring shenanigans. Sometimes going along with them, if the idea wasn’t too bad. If it wouldn’t get them into too much trouble.</p><p>But then Jiang Cheng never had a significant other, the way Jin Ling so obviously does. Didn’t even flirt with the village girls, the way his brother did.</p><p>(The few times he smiled at them, they didn’t smile back. So why bother trying?)</p><p>He heads back to his rooms and picks up the robes he borrowed from Lan Xichen just yesterday, now washed and neatly folded. The old woman in charge of the laundry had looked at him strangely when he brought another sect leader’s clothes to her and asked to have them cleaned, but she did it anyway and kept quiet about it.</p><p>It’s a wonder, really, how tight-lipped people are in Cloud Recesses, probably because talking about people behind their backs is prohibited (like almost everything else). Gossip is slow to move here, if it does at all. Which is one of the few aspects of this place Jiang Cheng actually likes.</p><p>Privacy is a wonderful thing.</p><p>As he passes through the winding corridors, making turn after turn of the route that is now becoming familiar to him, Jiang Cheng toys with the possibility of instituting sect rules of his own. An interesting idea, to be sure, a way to control the behavior of his sect members, but it would never work. The people of Yunmeng are far too independent and headstrong for that. There would be open rebellion within the month. For decades – centuries, perhaps – Lotus Pier has operated on a code of ‘do whatever you want, so long as no one gets hurt or killed’, pretty much relying on its inhabitants’ own moral compasses to stay functional.</p><p>It’s worked so far; or at least, Jiang Cheng thinks so.</p><p>He tosses the thought aside once the slatted wood path ends and opens up onto the garden. The ground is still a little muddy, on account of how hard it was heaving yesterday, and the flower bushes look a little less manicured than normal, though most of the broken twigs have already been snapped cleanly away and removed.</p><p>Lan Xichen answers the door barely five seconds after Jiang Cheng knocks. His hair is tied neatly back, the cuffs of his robes rolled up to his elbows, and his fingertips are smudged with ink, dark against his ivory skin. He greets Jiang Cheng with a smile – is it his imagination, or is that grin brighter than usual? – and an unhurried request for him to enter.</p><p>Jiang Cheng complies, and seats himself while the other man pours tea and sets out a mug for each of them. It’s calming, familiar even; though it’s only the fourth time they’ve done this, Jiang Cheng already feels at ease in the routine of these daily visits.</p><p>He reaches for the feeling he had this morning – the cold sinking of his gut at the thought that he could so easily fall into life in a place outside his home – but it’s not there. Instead, all there is is the warm comfort of the tea as it slides down his throat and settles inside him, chasing away the lingering chill.</p><p>Lan Xichen takes his own seat. They do away with pleasantries and dive straight into discussion – odd, for a meeting between two sect leaders, but then whatever it is they’re doing isn’t exactly official, and it gets dull after they’ve repeated each other’s titles for the third time. Jiang Cheng gives his report, and as per usual, Lan Xichen listens. Nods in all the right places, gives a ‘hmm’ where appropriate, and of course, expresses satisfaction over the progress the convocation has made.</p><p>When that’s over, Jiang Cheng finishes off the rest of his tea, and the older sect leader’s eyes zero in on the bundle of white cloth tucked under his arm. Jiang Cheng is almost ashamed to admit that he’d forgotten it was there the whole time, engrossed as he was in explaining the happenings of today’s meeting.</p><p>“I see you’ve brought something with you today?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng colours. He brings out the robes, still folded neatly, only slightly creased from the walk here, and passes them to Lan Xichen.</p><p>“These are yours,” he says finally, as the other man takes the bundle and sets it in his lap. <em>No shit, idiot</em>. “Thank you for the hospitality you so kindly extended yesterday. Especially for the clothes you lent to me.”</p><p>Gods damnit. Jiang Cheng can’t even say <em>that</em> without blushing. What is he – a teenage girl? But Lan Xichen is still smiling gently, not even a trace of mockery in his eyes. Jiang Cheng’s mouth suddenly feels very dry, and he has to swallow a few times before he can speak again.</p><p><em>Pull yourself together</em>.</p><p>“I thought it prudent,” he continues, as formally as possible to disguise his embarrassment, “to have them washed before returning them to you.” <em>Better</em>. Maybe he can make it through this without looking like an utter fool, after all.</p><p>“Thank you,” replies Lan Xichen, and his voice is filled with nothing but sincerity. Then he gets smoothly to his feet. “One moment, please.”</p><p>Holding the folded cloth, he leaves the room and vanishes down the short corridor. There is silence for a few moments, before he reappears. This time, the stack of fabric in his hands is a dark purple. Jiang Cheng instantly recognizes them as his own robes, and the heat in his cheeks rises.</p><p>He’s already stammering out an apology by the time Lan Xichen sits down again, rambling something about having forgotten to collect his clothes before he left yesterday. Without a doubt, Jiang Cheng already <em>has</em> made a fool of himself, and only about fifteen minutes into his visit, too.</p><p>He should have known better than to tempt fate like that.</p><p>The other man cuts him off just when he’s really getting going, somehow managing to do so in a manner that isn’t rude at all. Jiang Cheng couldn’t be more grateful.</p><p>“There’s no need to apologise,” Lan Xichen says smoothly, the corners of his mouth pulling upwards as though he’s laughing at something. It’s probably Jiang Cheng. Oh, yes, definitely him. “The circumstances were, ah, unusual ones. I might have done the same, were I in your position.”</p><p>The anxious knot in Jiang Cheng’s chest loosens at the easy way the acceptance falls out of the other man’s mouth.</p><p>“Besides, it wasn’t any difficulty. I took the liberty of having your robes washed as well. Unfortunately, I couldn’t do it myself. I’m rather unaccomplished in the domestic sphere, I’m afraid.”</p><p>Despite himself, Jiang Cheng smiles at that. He’s not exactly a domestic goddess either.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” he says. The lightness of his tone surprises him. “I’ve discovered that the lady responsible for such things is very competent.”</p><p>“Thank goodness. When we lived together, Meng Yao did all the laundry. I tried once; ended up ripping three sets of clothes before we agreed I was better off staying away altogether.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng notices the way Lan Xichen’s voice hitches before the birth name of the late Lanling Jin sect leader, then skips over it like a stone across the water. But the curve of his lips never wavers, and there’s a fondness in his dark gold eyes that remains untouched by hurt. Even so, the atmosphere in the room thickens.</p><p>The younger man casts about for something to alleviate the tension. His eyes alight on the low writing desk in the middle of the room, piled high with sheafs of paper. A pot of ink, and a simple wooden calligraphy brush, the tip now dry.</p><p>“Doing paperwork, I see,” he comments, lifting an eyebrow. By now, the action is more habit than skepticism, though he reserves his better versions of such expressions for situations where they are needed.</p><p>“A necessary evil in lives such as ours. My uncle once said that a sect is built on a sturdy stack of documents.” Lan Xichen lets out a self-deprecating chuckle. “It’s what I do these days.”</p><p>“I don’t envy you. My own stack is probably lying in wait on my desk as we speak.”</p><p>“Getting higher by the minute,” the older man finishes, grinning. In solidarity, Jiang Cheng thinks. Laugh because the only other option is to wallow in your own misery, and all that. He knows he takes a rather dim view of life, but paperwork is the bane of Jiang Cheng’s existence. He’d much rather enter a forest filled with fierce corpses and hit things.</p><p>Eventually, his curiosity gets the better of him. The only experience he has with running a sect is his own, and he’s always wondered about the duties of other clan heads.</p><p>“If I may ask, what is it about?” He phrases the question as politely as possible, waving at the sheets lying across the desk, covered in graceful, swooping strokes that he recognizes as Lan Xichen’s ridiculously elegant handwriting. The black ink matches the stains on Zewu-Jun’s fingers.</p><p>Jiang Cheng is respecting a response in much the same vein as the subjects of the documents he receives from his sect, and the taller man does not disappoint.</p><p>“Land deals, mostly. Reports on the general situations of a few of the villages in Gusu, now and then.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng nods. It seems that even between very different sects, there are some things that always remain the same.</p><p>Then Lan Xichen hesitates for a moment. His hand reaches up to grasp at his collar. The gesture is strangely nervous, a contrast to his usual poised demeanour. He looks as though he is considering something, contemplating whether or not to say it out loud.</p><p>Jiang Cheng remains silent, though he unconsciously leans forward a little in expectation. This is obviously important for the other sect leader – a piece of information he normally wouldn’t share.</p><p>After a while, he seems to come to a decision. His chest rises as he inhales deeply, and then he points to a document. One at the very centre of the small wooden table. The writing on it isn’t his. In fact, though the calligraphy brush is set neatly right next to the paper, it looks as though Lan Xichen hasn’t even touched it.</p><p>“That isn’t one of them,” he says. “It’s different.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“It’s a formal request from my sect’s Council of Elders. They want me to begin looking for a wife.”</p>

    <p>The moment the words leave Lan Huan’s mouth, he wants to swallow them back down and pretend he never said anything. Why did he bring that up? It isn’t necessary, isn’t related to Jiang Wanyin in any way other than the surface level ‘oh, another sect leader is going to try to get married’ sort of disinterested comment.</p><p>More than that, this issue is <em>private</em>. Between himself and the Council of Elders – the foremost authority in his sect. Lan Huan may be sect leader, but the Council has enough power to force him to make this decision if need be.</p><p>He’d received the missive this morning, looking innocuous enough among the other letters and forms in the daily stack of papers he had to look through. He hadn’t recognized it for what it was until he opened it, and was already halfway down the first page before the meaning of the words truly sank in.</p><p><em>The Council has come to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of all involved, if Sect Leader Lan were to wed as soon as possible</em>, the last line read. <em>A woman of good family and status, and a high cultivation level, able to bear children and continue the line</em>.</p><p>The whole letter was written in much the same way: cool and clinical, like a soldier’s report on a military mission. The threat implicit, hidden between the lines, but Lan Huan could see it clear as day. After all, he was brought up to look beyond the obvious.</p><p>The elders were – are – pressuring him. To participate in <em>xiangqin</em> matchmaking efforts, to find a wife, preferably within a short time frame, and produce an heir to be the next sect leader. As his father did.</p><p>Lan Huan has been staring at the letter all morning, trying to muster up a response. Long before Jiang Wanyin arrived, the characters had seared themselves into Lan Huan’s brain. He thinks he should have felt shocked. Angered, even, that the elders are sticking their wizened fingers into his personal life, meddling with it, handing him a piece of paper that says ‘<em>get married</em>’ and expecting him to hop to it. Like a dog that has been sent off to fetch a bone.</p><p>He should have been furious, that even this little shred of control, over when and whom he chooses to spend the rest of his life with, is being wrested away from him. That such an <em>order</em> has been dropped in his lap without so much as a ‘by your leave’.</p><p>But he didn’t. He couldn’t. Feel anything, that is. The only thing that welled up in his chest was a foglike numbness. Detachment.</p><p>Then Jiang Wanyin came and started asking questions, and suddenly there was a lighthouse in the mist, a formless, bright, shining thing that pierced through the fog. A single thought – no, a <em>need</em> – that said <em>tell him. Get it out</em>. Lan Huan doesn’t know why he listened. Why he’s letting this angry, bitter man witness his loss of control.</p><p>“Oh,” says the man. “I…I’m not sure how to respond to that.”</p><p>Lan Huan is at a loss for words. Of all the things he’d expected the willful, fiercely independent leader of the Yunmeng Jiang sect to say, that was not one of them.</p><p>The two of them sit in silence for a while, neither of them knowing what comes next. What <em>should</em> come next, by the rules of propriety and etiquette drummed into the both of them since birth. Neither of them has ever been in a situation like this before, and those rules don’t cover what to say when one’s fellow sect leader – a colleage, a co-worker – confesses to being pressured into marriage.</p><p>Or, Lan Huan thinks dryly, when one is confessing to being pressured into marriage.</p><p>Then Jiang Wanyin speaks again, his tone uncharacteristically soft. “What do you think about all this?”</p><p>Again, Lan Huan is thrown for a loop. In the Gusu Lan sect, questions are rare. There are rules, and there are protocols, and every member knows to follow them. Knows to do what they are told without argument, knows not to waste words on asking <em>why</em> when they already know <em>how</em>. Though Lan Huan has made countless choices in the thirty-some years since he was born into this clan, has had even more decisions made for him, rarely has he been asked how he feels about them.</p><p>No one has said such a thing to him in a long time. And Lan Huan suddenly feels the urge to answer.</p><p>“I knew it was coming. Something like it, anyway. As a sect leader, I need an heir.” It sounds so matter-of-fact and unfeeling, so much like the wording in the letter. The words taste like cotton and nothing.</p><p>“Your brother–”</p><p>“My brother is happily married. To a man. Such a union, however loving, will never produce children. Lan Sizhui may be their son, but he is not of the Lan bloodline. He is not mine, either.”</p><p>Lan Huan leans his weight away from the other man, rocking back onto his heels like a child who has been seated for too long. Jiang Wanyin’s brow furrows, his lips purse. He looks uncomfortable speaking of marriage and children. As though it’s not quite a foreign concept, but so far removed from him as to be nearly alien.</p><p>Another pregnant pause swells between them, like a soap bubble blown by a child, growing larger and larger until it pops.</p><p>“Do you want to get married?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter what I–”</p><p>The younger man fixes him with a glare that Lan Huan has never before seen – or wanted – directed at him. Those slate-grey eyes glint like light shining off the blade of a sword. There is steel in his voice as he asks again, quietly, “do you want to get married?”</p><p>Lan Huan feels the answer building at the base of his throat, pressing on his tongue. <em>No, it isn’t my choice</em> warring with <em>yes, I need to</em>. <em>I have to want it. It’s my duty</em>. But what finally spills out isn’t either of those things.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>For the first time in a long time, Jiang Cheng doesn’t know what to do. Sure, he’s been caught off guard a couple times, been backed into a corner seemingly with no way out, but he’s always had options. Give up or go on, run or fight. Even when they were in a life-or-death situation and the only thing he could do was go along with whatever crazy idea Wei Wuxian had cooked up, he always had something. A plan of some sort, no matter how insane.</p><p>Now, the circumstances aren’t nearly as dire. And Jiang Cheng draws a blank.</p><p>What is he supposed to say to that? He’s never been good with other people – his own numerous failures in the matchmaking department attest to that. Along with his distinct lack of friends apart from the man in front of him, who, despite the calm exterior he’s projecting, is practically vibrating with nervous energy.</p><p>How can Lan Xichen <em>not know</em>? It’s not like he’s hesitating on proposing to a girlfriend he’s had for ten years – this whole thing is as cut and dry as any situation can be. <em>Do you or do you not want to get hitched to a woman you’ll probably meet all of three times before the ceremony?</em></p><p>It’s a simple yes or no.</p><p>It’s also a really shit situation, from where Jiang Cheng is sitting. Not the marriage part itself – it’s common enough, especially among high-ranking cultivators like them – but the fact that Lan Xichen is getting forced into it. That he can’t even decide that he’s ready, or that he wants it. He’s the leader of the Gusu Lan sect – one of the most powerful men in the world. What’s the fucking point, if a bunch of old geezers can just march into his life and tell him what to do with it?</p><p>The few times Jiang Cheng tried the whole matchmaking thing, it was pretty damn awful. But it had at least been his choice. Lan Xichen doesn’t even have that.</p><p>The least Jiang Cheng can do is try to understand.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” He winces as the question leaves his mouth. He’s tried to gentle his tone a little, but it still comes off sounding accusatory. Not what he was going for.</p><p>The other man hesitates for a second before answering.</p><p>“I should be upset. This wasn’t my idea in the first place. But… I’m not. I don’t know. It doesn’t make sense.” He rubs at his face with his palm, turning into his hand as though he’s ashamed.</p><p>“It’s all right,” Jiang Cheng offers awkwardly. “You don’t owe anyone an explanation. Least of all me.”</p><p>“It’s just– I don’t <em>want</em> to fight it. The thing is, this is the best option for me. People from my sect, they – <em>we</em> – love once in our whole lives. We meet someone, and that’s it, that’s the person we’re going to spend the rest of our life with. There’s never anyone else.”</p><p>Lan Xichen is floundering, stumbling over his words; sounding nothing like his usual composed self. And for a moment, Jiang Cheng thinks of Lan Wangji, playing Inquiry every day for thirteen years while he waited for Wei Wuxian to return. The thirty-three lashes he suffered to protect him, and the three years it took to recover. Jiang Cheng thinks, too, of Lan An, the famed founder of the Gusu Lan sect, who left the clan he had built and retreated into a temple for the rest of his days to mourn his wife’s passing.</p><p>The older sect leader is still smiling, but it’s a shrunken thing, small and sad and wistful. “My father was that way. Shu-Fu used to tell us that he looked at our mother like she was the brightest star in the sky, and he fell like a comet plummeting to earth. And it–”</p><p>He pauses. Takes a shuddering breath.</p><p>“It destroyed him.”</p><p>Comprehension dawns on Jiang Cheng in the wordless quiet that follows. Lan Xichen is afraid. Jiang Cheng can see it in the way his fingers tremble, how he clasps his hands to cover the shaking. He’s fucking <em>terrified</em>. Not of the arranged marriage he’s being pressured into, but of the only other option that could lead to the same outcome. Love.</p><p>Yet he continues. “That’s what happens to the people in my family. What the elders are suggesting – it’s a sound proposal. It’s the best thing for the Gusu Lan sect. A marriage doesn’t need to be based on love. But if we can respect each other, that’s good enough.”</p><p><em>Good enough</em>. Jiang Cheng blinks, and a flash of memory lights the backs of his eyelids. A hot summer day, the smooth curved wood of a bow pressing into his twelve-year-old palm, an arrow clutched in his other hand. Wei Wuxian’s laughing face crumpled as he tried not to cry, Jiang Cheng forcing his spine ruler-straight even while he wished he could shrink into nothing. Ah-Niang shouting, and the perfectly ironed creases that stood out in the robes on Ah-Die’s retreating back.</p><p>
  <em>Is he not your son? Am I not your wife? Are we not good enough for you?</em>
</p><p>Everything in him recoils at the thought. Good enough? Not fucking likely.</p><p>Then he imagines white cloth in place of the violet, a forehead ribbon fluttering where there is nothing in the memory. Another woman where his Ah-Niang stands, features blurry. A different child, shoulders broader from hours of handstands, mouth set in a somber line while his eyes swim with tears. And Jiang Cheng’s chest <em>aches</em>, like it’s hollow where his heart should be and he’s only now realising it.</p><p>It’s wrong, he realises. This shouldn’t be Lan Xichen’s future. It can’t be.</p><p>But he can’t say any of this. Can’t get it out without sounding sour and controlling, because Jiang Cheng has never known what to say to make people not hate him.</p><p>He finds himself wishing for more tea, so he could have something to drink instead of wallowing in strained silence.</p><p>“<em>Xiangqin </em>is bullshit,” he says flatly. “Take it from someone who knows.”</p><p>Despite it all, Lan Xichen chuckles. Short and sharp, but amused all the same, somehow managing to slice right through the tension between them. Jiang Cheng feels his lips twitch upward at the sound, and suddenly the spike of bitterness in his gut dies down to a low thrum.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” the other man replies then, immediately serious and respectful. “I should not have made light of that. It was inappropriate.”</p><p><em>Considering all of your dating disasters</em>, are the words that go unspoken, but not unheard. Jiang Cheng has to repress a snort, and he takes advantage of the brief lull in the storm of his emotions to shove them all back in their box where they belong.</p><p>He waves his hand. “Don’t worry about it. I’ve made my peace with it. That’s the thing about official matchmaking channels – they’re not meant to work out anyway.”</p><p>“I thought that was what they were for?”</p><p>“In theory, yes. In practice, it’s more like they try to find someone who fits as many of the criteria for status as possible while ignoring everything else.”</p><p>Lan Xichen scrunches up his eyebrows, looking both thoughtful and disillusioned at the same time. “That sounds… unfortunate. I take it you don’t put much stock in traditional methods of arranging marriages, then.”</p><p>“No, I don’t. And I don’t see why anyone else would, either. Two people are pushed together based on their astrological charts and family positions, and are somehow supposed to spend the rest of their lives living out of each other’s pockets? Doesn’t exactly scream ‘fairytale ending’ to me.”</p><p>“It’s not supposed to,” Lan Xichen corrects him. “It’s not all about passion and unending devotion, you know. Sometimes happiness is stability, knowing there’s someone you can trust.” There’s some sort of revelation there, but before Jiang Cheng can fully grasp it, the older man’s amber eyes widen as the conversation catches up to him. <em>Oh, fuck</em>.</p><p>“Are you a <em>romantic</em>?”</p>

          <p>Hey everybody! Back with a new chapter! Whew, the first day of fake-orientation (before real orientation starts in February) was exhausting. So. Many. Talks. I'm not even kidding - they lectured us for almost seven hours. Oh, well; at least we had chairs.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who wished me luck for my exams. I actually did pretty well, if I may say so myself, considering I'm only half-Chinese and most of my schoolmates are a hundred percent.</p><p>Anyway, back to the story. I've always headcanoned that the unfortunate circumstances of LXC's parents have left him afraid of falling in love, because he's seen first-hand how devastating the impacts of it can be on the surrounding people. LWJ and WWX's love story only exacerbated that, because even though they got their happy ending, there was a lot of tragedy in the middle and again, LXC had to deal with the effects. So I feel like he would rather go for an arranged marriage-type thing, where he can be sure that he won't fall in love with his partner, which makes him feel safer. He knows how Lans fall in love, and he's trying to avoid that. At the same time, a spouse is someone who is practically obligated to stand by you, and his trust issues are having a field day with that.</p><p>JC, on the other hand, I've always felt is a closet romantic. He's the kind of person who will brush off any and all affection shown to him - not because he doesn't want it, but because he's so starved for it that he doesn't know how to react or what to do with it once it's been offered. He's seen his parents' marriage fall apart because it was arranged, and both of them were sure that the other didn't love them, so they never realised that they did. JYL, too, was only happy with JZX once the arranged marriage was called off and the two of them could fall in love on their own terms. Couple that with JC's own failed matchmaking attempts, and we have someone who probably has no faith in the xiangqin system whatsoever. I think that what he wants more than anything else is someone who loves him for himself, and not what he can do for them, but at the same time, he doesn't believe that people like him get happy endings.</p><p>So to sum this word vomit up, LXC is afraid of falling in love, and JC doesn't think it exists for him. If anyone disagrees with me, please let me know in the comments below and we can discuss :) Talking fandom is one of my favourite things (cue Sound of Music soundtrack).</p><p>Note: Sorry if this chapter is a little choppy, if it see-saws back and forth between light-heartedness and ANGST too much. As I've said before, I am a very, very amateur writer (who practically never gets good grades on writing projects, so I'm obviously doing something wrong), and while I'm trying to improve my skills, it's pretty slow going. That said, I hope you get at least some enjoyment out of this :))))) &lt;3333</p><p>Thank you all so much for reading, 'kudos'ing and commenting!</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng’s knee-jerk reaction is instant denial. “What? Fuck, no,” he retorts, trying to sound as vehement and outraged as possible. It doesn’t seem to be working, though, because Lan Xichen gives him a slow smile and cocks an eyebrow. Damn it. Jiang Cheng should really stop doing that in front of people. They’re stealing all his best expressions.</p><p>Against his will, warmth crawls up his neck and into his cheeks. He folds his arms across his chest defensively, hoping he doesn’t look as much like a child throwing a tantrum as he feels. “Maybe.”</p><p>The other man’s eyes sparkle with mirth, and for some reason, Jiang Cheng doesn’t feel as angry that he’s being made fun of as he probably should.</p><p>“It’s not anything to be ashamed of,” says Lan Xichen kindly, though he looks as if he’s struggling not to laugh. “I simply… didn’t think you were someone who would take such a view of the world. Forgive me for being mistaken.”</p><p>The heat in Jiang Cheng’s face reaches inferno levels.</p><p>How is it that every time he and Zewu-Jun have a private conversation, they wander so thoroughly off track? Every interaction they’ve had since the day Jiang Cheng first wandered into the garden has been utterly unexpected, wildly inappropriate under any circumstances between two sect leaders. But somehow, it seems natural. To exchange childhood stories, feelings of betrayal, to talk about <em>love</em>, of all things, with someone he can only barely consider a friend.</p><p>Even now, Lan Xichen has managed to coax out of Jiang Cheng a side of himself he’d thought he’d never admit to anyone, even on his deathbed. And it’s not earth-shattering at all; it’s just another thing the other man knows about him.</p><p>Why does everything with Lan Xichen feel so <em>easy</em>?</p><p>“I’m not ashamed of anything,” Jiang Cheng shoots back, just to be contrary. “I don’t hide who I am – it’s just easier to let people make their own assumptions, and I can’t be bothered to correct them.”</p><p>“Besides,” he adds, almost as an afterthought, “most of them don’t understand anyway.”</p><p>The smile on Lan Xichen’s face turns serious, though the light in his eyes stays. Jiang Cheng finds that he looks just as appealing this way – aesthetically, of course.</p><p>“What don’t they understand?”</p><p>“It’s– I know it’s not all just sunshine and rainbows. I know not everyone who marries for… for love gets a happy ever after. It’s hard, and I know that. You have to <em>try</em> to make it work, and sometimes it doesn’t.”</p><p>Lan Xichen nods, and Jiang Cheng feels a little ridiculous. For fuck’s sake, he’s getting all worked up while giving a speech about <em>love</em> – an area that the whole cultivation world knows he has depressingly little experience in. But the other man is looking at him with this intense focus, like there’s nothing else he’d rather be listening to. Like he actually cares what Jiang Cheng thinks.</p><p>So he keeps talking. “A lot of people don’t get that. They think that believing in love means believing everything ends great a hundred percent of the time, and that’s not realistic. But expecting that two people who are basically strangers will be able to settle down and have kids without wanting to strangle each other at the first viable opportunity? Thinking that everything afterwards is going to turn out just fine and dandy? That’s not realistic either.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng is aware that he’s ranting now, but Lan Xichen still seems transfixed and he’s not quite done yet.</p><p>“And maybe sometimes people who care about each other fuck up and end up hating each other, but at least they’ll have tried to make things work out first before it all crashes and burns. It’s a damn sight better than not caring enough to try at all.”</p><p>There. He’s said it. He’s finally fucking said it – the daydream of a stupid child who struggled not to cry at night, wondering if everything would be better if his mother didn’t spend hours screaming at his father. If Ah-Die did more than sigh and turn away when Ah-Niang was upset and angry with him.</p><p>If Ah-Niang didn’t grab Jiang Cheng’s shoulders and thrust him in between the two of them while she yelled for her husband to <em>listen</em>. If he didn’t have to watch Ah-Jie’s eyes slowly grow redder as the quarrel grew louder. If…</p><p>There are so many ‘if’s, and Jiang Cheng thinks he could drown in them.</p><p>His mind is miles away; he doesn’t even realise it until fingers brush against the back of his hand. It’s that touch, more than anything else, that yanks him back to the tiny living room in a corner of Cloud Recesses, that anchors him to his body.</p><p>His hands are shaking. Trembling a little, possibly because of everything he’s <em>feeling</em> right now. Jiang Cheng just wants it to stop.</p><p>And then there is a touch, warm against his knuckles, his wrist. Roughened with calluses, but somehow so fucking graceful, delicate even. He looks down; Lan Xichen’s hand is laid over his, palm pressed to Jiang Cheng’s skin.</p><p>The hand is connected to an arm, which apparently turns out to be connected to the rest of a whole human being, and as his gaze travels upward, Jiang Cheng fixes on the other man’s face. His eyes are burning, gold heated to a molten liquid, but there is something soft in them, mild instead of searing.</p><p>The gesture should be awkward, should be thoroughly improper considering their standings and situations, but it’s not. It feels like comfort and safety and <em>somebody cares</em>, and in this moment, the raging storm in Jiang Cheng’s head quiets.</p><p>All that’s left is peace. Calm.</p><p>Lan Xichen doesn’t break eye contact as he says again, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“For being one of those people who don’t understand. I didn’t know, but I think… I think I see now.”</p><p>After that, what can Jiang Cheng do in response besides smile helplessly? His eyes sting and water, and he curses himself for it. <em>Oh no you don’t, you sappy fucker</em>.</p><p>Then Lan Xichen seems to realise that his hand is still resting on Jiang Cheng’s, and he withdraws it, that soft look still shining out of his face. Without the warmth of skin-to-skin contact, Jiang Cheng’s hand suddenly feels cold. A little bereft, as though something’s supposed to be there but isn’t.</p><p>He curses himself again. Buries the feeling.</p><p>Clasping his hands together again, Jiang Cheng clears his throat to break the silence. “You’re probably wondering why I even tried the whole <em>xiangqin</em> thing in the first place, since I obviously don’t believe in it.”</p><p>“You’ve found me out,” the older sect leader says lightly. “I am rather curious about that.”</p><p>“But you don’t need to tell me if you don’t want to,” he adds, hurried. His cheeks are dusted a light pink, and it’s actually kind of cute. In the way that dogs and other small animals are cute, naturally.</p><p>“It’s fine. It’s just, talking about it, it seems kind of strange. I mean, I went through the whole thing three times. I <em>have</em> to have thought it was worth it at some point, right?”</p><p>“That’s what one would assume, yes.”</p><p>A laugh bubbles up in Jiang Cheng’s throat, and he only barely manages to catch it before it slips out. He feels weightless, like he could push off the ground and keep rising for all eternity. Like he can do anything. “Honestly, I don’t really know why I did it. I think, like you, it was mostly the clan elders who persuaded me to try.”</p><p>Lan Xichen stiffens, his posture growing rigid.</p><p>“I wasn’t as–” <em>angry, bitter, jaded</em> – “skeptical as I am now, else I never would have gone along, but even back then, it didn’t seem like a good idea. There were too many things that could go wrong, and my heart just wasn’t in it.” He shrugs, barks a laugh that’s meant to come off as self-deprecating but really just sounds sad. “Jin Ling was still a baby then, and his parents had just died. Women weren’t exactly lining up outside Lotus Pier to deal with that.”</p><p><em>And I was a mess</em>, he doesn’t say. <em>That was the main problem. </em>The women – the female cultivators who <em>had</em> tried to reach out weren’t enthusiastic about looking after a squalling child that wasn’t theirs, sure, but some had been willing to work around it. It was Jiang Cheng himself they couldn’t deal with.</p><p>All the baggage, the issues he won’t let himself acknowledge. The constant, burning anger that was his only real friend for the past fourteen years. He’s not exactly a fantastic fucking catch.</p><p>But the other man just watches him intently, as though Jiang Cheng is a puzzle he can’t figure out how to solve. Curiosity simmering in his expression, unaccompanied by the cloying, sticky sweetness of sympathy.</p><p>“I half-assed my application,” he admits. “Threw in some bullshit requirements I figured the ideal wife of a sect leader would have, and washed my hands of the whole thing.”</p><p>A soft chuckle makes its way to Jiang Cheng’s ears. It’s a nice sound, low and deep, fuzzy round the edges like a worn blanket, and satisfaction curls deep inside his gut. <em>I did that</em>, a pleased little voice purrs in his hear.</p><p>He doesn’t have the time to shut it up before Lan Xichen is speaking again. Jiang Cheng makes an effort to ignore his windbag of a subconscious, and realises he’s being asked a question.</p><p>“I’ve been wondering what a man like yourself would look for in a wife. Forgive me if this is too personal – I don’t mean to pry – but what were the requirements?”</p><p>Oh, damn. He should have seen this coming the moment he mentioned it. Naïve of him to assume that Zewu-Jun’s morality floats too high above the ruckus of the mortal world for him to appreciate a good piece of gossip.</p><p>Briefly, Jiang Cheng considers saying no, backing out of the conversation before he reveals more than he wants to about himself, because Jiang Cheng’s insides are even uglier than the rest of him, and everyone who’s ever taken a good look has run away screaming. But hey, he’s a grown-ass adult man; he can handle a little rejection. It’s not like Lan Xichen’s going to tell anyone.</p><p>Hell, Jiang Cheng is going to let himself be reckless. Just for today.</p><p>“The usual. Good family, low to mid-tier cultivation level, physically attractive, decent spending habits.” Then Jiang Cheng ducks his head, abruptly overcome with embarrassment. Recklessness is not a good look on him. “And she had to treat Jin Ling well.”</p><p>Great. Just great. He <em>knows</em> the requirements were shallow. Every red-blooded male’s fantasy of a subservient wife catering to his every need, come to life. Ah-Jie would probably give him the tongue-lashing of the century if she knew. And that would be nothing compared to what Ah-Niang would do to him.</p><p>But gods in heaven, when that fucking matchmaking form was staring him in the face, Jiang Cheng’s mind had gone blank. He didn’t know what he wanted, what kind of person he’d want to spend the rest of his life with, because the simple fact was that despite their claims to the contrary, no one had ever been willing to do the same with him. And even if he had known, a piece of paper wasn’t going to help him find it.</p><p>So he said ‘screw it’, and filled in the most generic description of an ideal wife he could think of. The last requirement – the one about Jin Ling – was the only concession he’d made to himself. The one thing he was absolutely sure he wanted. Needed.</p><p>Still, Lan Xichen probably thinks he’s a massive douchebag right now. Jiang Cheng can’t exactly disagree. He wonders what that says about him.</p><p>But the other man takes him by surprise. Another grin tugs at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“I think that’s very admirable. Not many people in your position would consider a child, much less use that as a basis for the acceptance of a potential partner. You care for your nephew.”</p><p>It’s a statement, not a question, said with such assurance and faith that Jiang Cheng is momentarily struck dumb. <em>That’s</em> what Lan Xichen took away from everything he’s just said?</p><p>Of fucking course he loves Jin Ling; the brat’s his sister’s son. But more than that, he’s Jiang Cheng’s kid. How could he not love him, not take his wants and needs and wellbeing into consideration? His nephew is worth more to him than some nameless woman who fills a set of criteria he wrote down on a whim. Jin Ling is <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng fixes the man opposite him with the steeliest glare he can manage. “I do not <em>need</em> admiration for doing my duty to my family. Nor do I want it. And anyone who would not do the same is a spineless rat who does not deserve the ones they claim to love.”</p>

          <p>Hi!!!!! I'm back! Sorry that I didn't update yesterday - I had a few hours in the middle of the day when I was at school, but it was so insanely awkward to write fanfiction in the canteen that I just didn't, and the rest of the day was really hectic because now Friday softball trainings end at 7 o' clock, so yeah. But here we are.</p><p>I won't say much about this chapter, because I think it's pretty self-explanatory. I've thought a lot about JC's "matchmaking list", as I call it, and have come to a few conclusions. Maybe a large portion of the fandom disagrees with me, but I headcanon that he didn't really try that hard to come up with his requirements. Because if you look at them, most of them are pretty impersonal. Like, they could probably be found in any man's fantasy of his "ideal woman". (You might also find a good few of them in any woman's fantasy of her "ideal man", but that's not the point.) Most of the time, when someone is thinking about the kind of partner they'd like to have, they get a little more specific. For example, 'must like science fiction books', 'good listener', 'could talk for hours about social justice issues','doesn't mind getting woken up at three in the morning to listen to rants about Disney movies', etcetera. But JC's list? Zip, zilch, nada. The only time he acknowledges his personal situation is the part where he mentions JL, and that's it. So I'm not sure he put a lot of effort into this thing. Maybe he just wanted a mother figure for JL, rather than a spouse. Maybe he didn't want to get married at all. Who knows? Not me.</p><p>Anyway, this is merely my personal headcanon. If you disagree, as always, let me know in the comments below :)</p><p>By the way, I've been thinking of a few other fic ideas, but am currently too busy to write them. If anyone is strapped for ideas and wants to borrow them, please feel free. (If you would like to talk about them some more, I would be happy to oblige.) I would LOVE to see any one of these fics actually written out. Unfortunately, I can't do that myself. So here goes:</p><p>1. Voltron: Legendary Defender AU<br/>Yes, this is a new fandom I have joined recently and I am loving the whole team-of-teenagers-piloting-giant-robots-in-space idea. (BTW, Lance and Lotor are my favourite characters, and Hunk is a sweetheart. Shiro is also cool.) So I got to thinking: what if we had the cast of MDZS piloting said robots instead, replacing disaster teenagers with only-barely-functioning adults who low-key don't like each other and somehow have to save the universe. Includes LXC (Black Paladin), LWJ (Yellow Paladin), NHS (Green Paladin), WWX (Blue Paladin), JC (Red Paladin), WRH (Zarkon), XY (Haggar), JGY (Lotor), WQ (Princess Allura), and LQR (Coran). Also, the other previous paladins are NMJ (Red), JGS (Blue), JFM (Yellow) and QHJ (Green). CSSR is Krolia and JFM was quietly training WWX to be the next Yellow Paladin, but only YZY knew, and that caused a lot of tension in the household.</p><p>2. XiCheng Modern AU<br/>JC is a struggling singer who works part-time in a music store and takes whatever small gigs he can get while writing songs on the side, while his brother WWX is a successful actor dating equally-successful businessman LWJ. WWX wants to help JC get a job, but JC's pride is a little too strong for that; even though he actually does have the talent to make it big, he just has bad luck when it comes to getting "discovered". LXC is an also-successful music producer who's just catapulted a band called Yi City to stardom, and is at a loss for what to do next. His two best friends (JGY and NMJ) have also just had a falling-out and his lease is expiring, so he's kind of miserable and needs a new place to stay. As luck would have it, a spot opens up in the apartment above JC's in his pretty crappy building, so WWX figures it's match-making time and talks the apartment up a whole lot to get LXC to move in. JC and LXC become neighbours, and LXC is fascinated by his downstairs neighbour who plays guitar and sings original songs on the fire escape at two in the morning, while JC is baffled that this aggressively attractive, super-nice person wants to talk to him. Of course, neither of them know who the other is, and so it goes about as well as you'd expect.</p><p>Hope you guys liked the chapter! Have a good day!</p>

    <h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
    <p>Lan Huan is taken aback by the pure frigidity of Jiang Wanyin’s tone. It’s a direct contrast to the heat raging in his eyes. His voice has dropped a register, and his pupils are blown wide, the black swallowing the grey whole, colour high in his cheeks. He looks dangerous like this, on the edge of the fury he is so known for.</p><p>Distantly, Lan Huan registers that the other man is <em>glaring</em> at him – that that fury is being turned on him – but that realisation is drowned out by the little buzzing voice that whispers that in this impassioned state, the Yunmeng Jiang sect leader is really very attractive. It’s that same voice, persistent and irritating, that reminds Lan Huan that he’s taken other lovers before. Men and women both.</p><p><em>Please be quiet</em>, he begs it, even as liquid heat pools in the pit of his stomach. His face flushes involuntarily. Lan Huan hopes that Jiang Wanyin thinks it’s from embarrassment at his verbal misstep. He <em>truly</em> hopes so.</p><p>“I– I apologise,” he manages to get out, voice wavering despite his best efforts to keep it steady. “I meant no offense by it. It’s simply that I rarely see such open devotion, especially within high-ranking cultivator families.”</p><p>The spots of pink on Jiang Wanyin’s cheeks spread, creeping down his neck, and his eyes widen a little in what looks like surprise. It is as though the younger man hasn’t even considered that his behavior – his obvious concern for a child that is not his – might be unusual. As though he cannot fathom anyone thinking otherwise.</p><p>It is… oddly endearing. To see someone as notorious, as feared as Sandu-Shengshou show such dedication to his family that he goes up in arms at the mere insinuation that it might be possible not to care as much as he does.</p><p>Lan Huan thinks he should be offended; after all, the other sect leader is being rather disrespectful. But he finds that he doesn’t feel insulted at all. Instead, he is simply curious.</p><p>What is it about this man that makes him who he is? How can he harbor two sides of himself, both so different: the fearless, wrathful cultivator who feels nothing but bitterness and rage, and the young man who loves his family and feels <em>so very much</em>? Lan Huan might be tempted to believe that they are two separate people, if he hasn’t seen with his own eyes that they are one and the same.</p><p>The man in question tenses, walls going up. His left thumb and index finger twist the silver ring on his right hand – a gesture Lan Huan has noticed that he repeats often, especially when he is ill at ease.</p><p>“I, too, am sorry,” he says after a moment, his voice lacking its characteristic sharpness. “That was extremely ill-mannered of me; I was out of line. It will not happen again.”</p><p>Abruptly, every hint of anger goes out of him at once, like air escaping from an inflated bladder. Jiang Wanyin slumps, almost imperceptibly, seeming almost ashamed of his loss of control. Lan Huan can’t help the faint curl of disappointment in his stomach, though he tries valiantly to ignore it as he rises to pour more tea.</p><p>By the time he sits back down, the other man seems more collected. More secure in his hold on his own emotions. He accepts the refilled mug, steaming as Lan Huan hands it to him, with grace, and sets it aside to cool. Lan Huan takes a sip of his own drink and winces at the heat.</p><p>Then Jiang Wanyin opens his mouth to speak. “It was rather difficult for the matchmakers to find someone who fit every item on the list I gave. In the end, they could only rustle up three candidates, and when none of them worked out, that was the end of that. The elders didn’t bring it up again.”</p><p>It’s as though their previous tense interaction never even occurred. The other sect leader’s expression has iced over, his face blank, all traces of emotion wiped away. Lan Huan feels a pang of loss, and covers it up by downing another scorching mouthful of his tea. He can barely feel his tongue anymore.</p><p>“Was that what you were hoping for?”, he asks carefully. Jiang Wanyin is so <em>volatile</em>, a stack of dry kindling piled high in the middle of the woods. A single spark could set him alight, and though the flames would be beautiful, Lan Huan isn’t sure he wants to see what a forest looks like when it burns.</p><p>“Not exactly. I suppose– I suppose I wanted to see how it would all pan out. If I might have been wrong.”</p><p><em>I wanted to be</em>. The words are cold and logical, seemingly emotionless, but Lan Huan has spent all his life prying feelings from people who do not like to show them. He can hear the sadness there, the disappointment, undercut with a longing so strong that it nearly overtakes him, forcing itself down his throat and into his lungs, and Lan Huan can barely breathe.</p><p>A longing to be loved – that’s what it is. Of that, Lan Huan is certain. Everything he’s learned about Jiang Wanyin until now only confirms it. The way he talks about his nephew, the way a fire lights in his eyes when he speaks about caring. <em>Trying</em>.</p><p>Something barbed catches in Lan Huan’s throat, piercing his flesh as he tries to swallow. He’s known this man for years, since they were both nothing more than children. They have run side-by-side into battle, fought simultaneously for scraps of respect in a world they were too young for, grown up watching each other live out their lives in a mirror of their own. And Lan Huan has never seen this. Never seen anything more than a cold, cruel shell of a cultivator who ruled his sect with an iron fist, never seen past the anger and the rage to catch a glimpse of the man hoping desperately for someone to love him.</p><p><em>It’s not worth it</em>, his mind thinks, even as his heart twists within his ribcage. It sounds beautiful, and in another life, Lan Huan might even have hoped for the same. But he’s seen first-hand how love destroys, how it sinks its claws into its victims, ripping them apart if they draw closer together, or farther apart. How its roots burrow into the soil of everywhere, tearing up the earth when it finally self-destructs. How its wings spread wide to block out the sun, to block out the light so nothing else will ever grow in its shadow.</p><p>Love is a nightmare creature. Lan Huan knows it with every bone in his body. He also knows that sometimes even when people care, they don’t try. And they let things fall to pieces because they don’t know how to fix them, and there are consequences.</p><p>There are always consequences, in the aftermath.</p><p>When Lan Huan was six years old, and Wangji was three – too young to understand much of anything – he asked Shu-Fu why they only ever visited their mother once a month, when all the other children saw theirs every day. The end of Shu-Fu’s beard twitched, and Lan Huan usually laughed when that happened, but today it wasn’t funny. <em>Your mother did a bad thing, Ah-Huan</em>, Shu-Fu said, his voice solemn and somber, sinking like a stone. <em>And she has to be very quiet for a while. So she can’t see you and Wangji, because she’s being quiet.</em></p><p><em>What about our father?</em> Then Shu-Fu’s mustache drooped, which was something Lan Huan couldn’t remember seeing before. He smiled too, which was also something that hardly ever happened. But it was sad, and it drooped at the edges, just like Shu-Fu’s mustache.</p><p><em>Your father loves her, Ah-Huan</em>, came the reply. Lan Huan didn’t understand why Shu-Fu kept repeating his name. <em>He loves her, so he’s keeping quiet with her. They’re together, you see, because they love each other</em>.</p><p>That was the first time Lan Huan realised that love hurt. Because their mother and father loved each other so much that they didn’t have any left for him and Wangji, and that was why it couldn’t be all <em>four</em> of them keeping quiet together. It had been summer then in the Cloud Recesses, but all he could think about was how cold that made him feel.</p><p>Now that Lan Huan is older and a little wiser, the cold feeling still hasn’t gone away.</p><p>He thinks he understands where Jiang Wanyin is coming from, but that isn’t for him. Lan Huan believes in love, but he doesn’t have faith in it. All it ever seems to do is mess everything up.</p><p>“Thank you for your insights,” he says. He feels sluggish, as though he’s just surfaced from a long time spent under the water of the cold springs. And before his slow-moving brain can catch up with his mouth, he says, “I hope you can find someone who fills your requirements.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin cocks his head, giving him an unreadable look.</p><p>“Your <em>real</em> requirements.”</p><p>Then Lan Huan’s mind finally begins to run at its normal pace, and he suddenly feels a terrible urge to lock himself in his room and refrain from coming out for the rest of the afternoon. That was… not inappropriate, per say, but it was strange. Certainly not something one would say. Ever. In any context.</p><p>But the other man is smiling. He seems lighter, somehow, as though a burden has been lifted from his shoulders. “What are yours?”</p><p>Lan Huan can only stare dumbly as he attempts to process the question.</p><p>“My–?”</p><p>“<em>Your</em> requirements. For the <em>xiangqin </em>procedure. You didn’t think I was the only one who had to make a list, did you? It’s standard protocol.” Jiang Wanyin is relaxed now, smirking, more at ease than before. The suddenness with which he switches between aloofness and warmth makes Lan Huan’s head spin.</p><p>It also keeps him off-balance enough not to notice that the man seated opposite him has correctly deduced that Lan Huan is going to go through with his original plan anyway, regardless of their earlier – rather heated – conversation.</p><p>“I– Well, I– ”</p><p>“–you?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” he finally admits. Dear founders, his face is burning. And was he <em>stuttering</em> just now? “I haven’t given much thought to it.”</p><p><em>Distracted</em>, he realises. He’s so distracted that he doesn’t even have room to slip back into the frigid water that claimed him not five minutes ago. Normally, once he begins to think about it, he’ll be sucked in, and no matter how many times something hauls him out again, he’ll keep spiraling, downwards and downwards, for the rest of the day. Lost in his own thoughts. His memories.</p><p>But it seems that this time, he’s managed to drag himself back onto dry land.</p><p>“You have to have <em>some</em> idea of the person you want to spend the rest of your life with,” states Jiang Wanyin, somehow managing to convey an eyeroll without even moving his eyes. It’s impressive. “Otherwise you wouldn’t even be considering this whole matchmaking thing. Clusterfuck, whatever.”</p><p>If the younger sect leader were anyone else, Lan Huan might give him what Lan Jingyi has dubbed ‘the smile of passive-aggressive disapproval’. After all, cursing is another one of the things prohibited by their sect, and most other cultivators seem to respect that, at least in front of Gusu Lan clan members. Not the head of the Yunmeng Jiang sect, apparently. But Jiang Wanyin’s foul mouth is just another side to him, a different facet of the man himself that’s as much a part of him as his fiery temper.</p><p>Lan Huan doesn’t mind. He finds it inexplicably liberating.</p><p>“Honest.” He blurts out the first thing that comes into his head. “Whoever it is, they have to be honest.” The other man nods in understanding, and Lan Huan continues, encouraged. “Loyal. I’d like them to be loyal.”</p><p>“Anything that might be easier for the matchmakers to pick out? <em>Not</em> personality traits?”</p><p>He frowns. “It doesn’t matter. Not to me, anyway. It’s not really important.”</p><p>“What is, then?”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Lan Huan turns the question over in his head. Those traits – yes, they’re necessary, crucial, actually; but the thing he needs most is still sitting inside him, silent and unsaid. He huffs out a breath. Makes a decision.</p><p>“They need to put duty first, above all else. The fate of our family, our sect. Nothing, <em>nothing</em> is more important than that.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin goes quiet, as though he’s considering what to say. Then his internal argument seems to come to some sort of resolution. “I think the whole time I was going through the motions, I knew that no matter what happened, or how good the fit was, I wasn’t going to go through with it.” He offers the words like a poor man presenting the last of his meager coin – as though they are precious, guarded. Lan Huan thinks they might be.</p><p>“The person I described – the person I said I wanted,” his voice hitches, “wasn’t a wife. It was my sister.”</p><p>Gold eyes widen in understanding. “Your nephew needed a mother.”</p><p>“Yes,” he says simply. “But I still wouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because then I would have had to have children. And I didn’t want to do to Jin Ling what my parents did to me.”</p><p>It’s a confession. Short and sharp, but it hangs in the air long after Jiang Wanyin has finished speaking. The power of it would bring Lan Huan to his knees, if he were still standing. Lan Huan recognizes it for what it is: a truth for a truth. Paying him back for the parts of himself he’s just bared.</p><p>But what Jiang Wanyin has shown him is so <em>raw</em>. It feels as though the younger man has stripped himself down to the bone, and allowed Lan Huan to take a look. It doesn’t seem fair.</p><p>More. He needs to give more.</p><p>“My parents were a disaster,” Lan Huan says. It’s the most informal, the freest he’s ever been with his words, and even though it hurts to acknowledge, it’s true. Opposite him, Jiang Wanyin chokes on a laugh. It’s not that funny – especially considering, well, everything – but Lan Huan finds that his own laughter comes easier than expected.</p><p>“We’re both pretty fucked up, aren’t we?”</p><p>“Just a little bit.”</p>

          <p>Hey!!!!! Welcome back, guys. Thanks to everyone who's been reading and leaving comments thus far. I haven't really been that busy these few days, but procrastination is a plague, and I've just been attending orientation talk after orientation talk that basically just tells us the exact same thing every time: "JC is where you go to fail, and your dreams go to die." That's it. But oh, well; I'm holding out hope that they're just scaring us, and it's going to be manageable.</p><p>Anyway, this chapter is just gratuitous LXC angst. Also I couldn't resist putting the first part in here, because the manhua showed us how devastatingly attractive JC is when he's angry. I'm a desperate thirsty fangirl, and this fic is basically my wish-fulfilment, so now you all have to suffer in the pit that I have created. MWAHAHAHA!!!!</p><p>So, uh, hope you guys have a great week, and see you all next time! :)</p><p>Note: Please check out the amazing, super-talented @odd-well on Tumblr. I've forgotten to put this up til now, but they've created some great fanart for this fic, and I absolutely love it.</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng ends up staying for lunch. And well into the afternoon. They don’t plan it that way – it’s just something that happens. Talk turns away from the heavy stuff, as though they both recognize that they’ve said enough for one day.</p><p>And then Lan Xichen asks if Jiang Cheng is hungry. Like an idiot, he says yes. He can hardly be blamed for it; he forgot to eat breakfast this morning in favour of arriving at the meeting-place as early as possible, and it’s now mid-day. Of course he’s hungry.</p><p>Jiang Cheng wasn’t counting on Lan Xichen’s response, however. The older sect leader practically beams, like his own personal fucking sun, and asks Jiang Cheng if he’ll teach him to fry vegetables so they can eat lunch together. Alarm bells immediately begin to sound in Jiang Cheng’s head as he remembers the conversation they had not three days ago. <em>I tried making a stir-fry once; almost set the whole kitchen on fire.</em> Those were the exact words spoken, and Jiang Cheng doesn’t really want to be responsible for Cloud Recesses going up in flames. Again.</p><p>But Lan Xichen is giving him this <em>look</em>, one that Jiang Cheng interprets as ‘say no and you’ll immediately feel like you’ve kicked a baby seal’, and fuck damnit, Jiang Cheng absolutely does not need to feel like even more of a garbage human being than he already is. So it’s with an air of resignation, and the apprehension of a man walking to the gallows, that Jiang Cheng acquiesces.</p><p>Fast forward fifteen minutes, the kitchen is in chaos, and it’s every bit the disaster Jiang Cheng predicted it would be. For the record, he <em>still</em> has no idea how they got here.</p><p>What happened was this: unwilling to leave Lan Xichen, the self-proclaimed domestic failure, to his own devices, Jiang Cheng opted for controlled supervision instead. Like the responsible adult he is. He gave directions and the other man followed them, while Jiang Cheng watched over his shoulder to make sure nothing went terribly wrong. It was progressing relatively well, the <em>qingjiang-cai</em> leaves sizzling merrily in the wok, and for once, Jiang Cheng allowed himself to entertain the possibility that they might manage to make it through this successfully. Without any tragic mishaps resulting in injury and potential loss of life.</p><p>Of course, that was the moment that everything went to hell.</p><p>The oil spattered suddenly, bubbling and bursting, and Lan Xichen let out a high-pitched noise that Jiang Cheng was certain was an honest-to-gods shriek. Someone knocked over something with a series of loud crashes, and then the stove was <em>on fucking fire</em>, smoke filling the room, and the kitchen was altogether too small for two grown men when one of them was losing his shit.</p><p>Which is where they are in this current moment. Red and orange and yellow tongues of flame shooting up towards the ceiling. Blistering heat radiating from the wok, where the unfortunate <em>qingjiang-cai</em> has probably long since blackened and turned to ash. Lan Xichen panicking, and Jiang Cheng only barely managing to hold him back from dumping a bucket of water over the stove long enough to grab a nearby bag of salt and pour <em>that </em>on the flames instead.</p><p>White grains spill across the counter, onto the floor, but Jiang Cheng can’t bring himself to give a flying fuck, not when the fire has <em>finally </em>died away with the addition of the salt. Lan Xichen is leaning against the counter, a shell-shocked expression on his face. He’s not moving – and he’s <em>in the</em> <em>way</em> – so Jiang Cheng doesn’t feel bad in the slightest when he pushes roughly past the other man, grabs the wok by the handle and practically tosses it into the sink.</p><p>“You,” he bites out, rounding on Lan Xichen, “are <em>never</em> allowed within ten feet of a stove. Ever. Again.”</p><p>As if on cue, the oil in the wok gives a last, pathetic hiss. The vegetables are past saving, stuck to the bottom of the pan and charred beyond all recognition. And they’re <em>smoking</em>.</p><p>Lan Xichen nods timidly. The only thing his face shows is a faint look of horror. “Never,” he agrees.</p><p>“Not even in your house.”</p><p>Vigorous head shaking. “Not even in my house.”</p><p>Then Jiang Cheng follows his gaze to the stone panel behind the stove. Once white, it’s now burned almost completely black, the panels around it streaked with soot. Lan Xichen blinks. “I don’t even know what I did wrong,” he says forlornly.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s knees go soft, and he slumps against the sink. His shoulders begin to shake; he doesn’t even make an effort to stop them. A hand moves to cover his face, and then Lan Xichen is leaning over him, all thoughts of the recent disaster seemingly forgotten.</p><p>“Are you alright?”, he asks, concerned. That’s when Jiang Cheng can’t hold it in anymore. His hand falls, the shaking intensifies, and he starts to laugh. He laughs until his stomach convulses and aches, until he’s wheezing and gasping for breath. It’s not laughter of relief – that they’ve only narrowly managed to avoid death by grease inferno – but rather pure, unadulterated mirth. And all the while, Lan Xichen is looking at him with an expression that radiates confusion and screams ‘<em>what the hell is going on?</em>’ But at the same time, there’s also a tiny, bewildered smile on his face.</p><p>As though Jiang Cheng’s amusement makes him happy.</p><p><em>Stupid fucking fuzzy thoughts</em>, he thinks, without any heat, as he struggles to get himself back under control. Gods, he hasn’t laughed that hard in a long time.</p><p>“I can’t believe,” says Jiang Cheng, in between heavy pants, “that you managed to start a fucking fire while cooking <em>vegetables</em>.”</p><p>Lan Xichen doesn’t say anything, just folds his arms across his chest in a defensive pose. His smile turns down a little at the edges, his bottom lip jutting out, and holy Guanyin-Ma he’s pouting. Zewu-Jun, the esteemed leader of the Gusu Lan sect, known for its strict rules and the iron self-discipline of its disciples, is <em>pouting</em> because Jiang Cheng pointed out that he’s a shitty cook.</p><p>This is too good.</p><p>“I was watching you the whole time, and I still don’t know how you did it.”</p><p>The other man shifts his weight awkwardly. “Can we please not talk about this?”, he pleads, dark gold eyes round and huge as dinner plates. Jiang Cheng must be going soft, because he relents.</p><p>“Alright, alright,” he says, taking pity on the poor soul who looks like he’s about to expire from humiliation any minute. “Now, will you help me clean this up, or are you going to set anything else on fire?” Okay, so maybe he’s not <em>quite</em> done teasing the older man just yet.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s brows knit together. It’s the closest thing Jiang Cheng’s ever seen to a scowl on the normally unflappable sect leader. Even though he can tell it’s half-hearted and formed mostly from discomfort, the sternness in Zewu-Jun’s eyes, the steely set of his mouth… It’s kind of hot.</p><p>
  <em>Where did that come from?</em>
</p><p>With an effort, Jiang Cheng pushes the thought away and buries it. Finally, he shuts up, rifles around for two towels and, passing one to Lan Xichen, they start the long, agonizing process of putting the kitchen to rights after the mess they’ve just made. They wipe down the wall, cleaning away the soot streaks, and Jiang Cheng makes the other man clean the stove while he tackles the wok. It’s hard – the vegetables have left a crusty residue on the metal bottom, and oil stains are stubborn little bastards – but they eventually settle into it. Then Lan Xichen says something, Jiang Cheng says something back, and before he knows it, he’s laughing again, hard enough to cramp his midsection, and this time, Lan Xichen is laughing with him.</p><p>It takes them nearly three hours to return the kitchen to a state that doesn’t look like a tornado blew through it. By then, both of them have pretty much given up on anything resembling lunch. Interestingly enough, neither brings up the possibility of another attempt at cooking.</p><p>When the two of them finally deem each other’s handiwork satisfactory, they emerge into the living room, tired and probably smelling of smoke. It’s an effort to execute a controlled descent into a seated position instead of a graceless flop – Jiang Cheng manages it only through sheer force of will; it might be his imagination, but even Lan Xichen’s movements seem a whole lot less elegant than usual.</p><p>The younger man stretches out his arm, sore from scrubbing out stubborn residue from the bottom of a wok for the better part of three hours. As a cultivator, he’s in good physical shape – in his position, he needs to be – but household work uses a whole different set of muscles than sparring and sword drills, and it’s not something he does often, for obvious reasons. It fucking <em>burns</em>.</p><p>Across from him, Lan Xichen is rotating his wrists in tiny circles, working out the kinks in his joints. Jiang Cheng figures he hasn’t had to clean up after himself very much – it showed in the kitchen, when Jiang Cheng had to teach him how to properly wipe away grease stains so they wouldn’t leave a sheen of oil on the countertop – but he went along rather gamely, all considered. Didn’t even put up a fuss over getting his hands dirty.</p><p>And make no mistake – fire clean-up is <em>filthy</em>. Jiang Cheng knows that much from his own disastrous first attempts at cooking back in his teenage years. The soot gets everywhere, all over your clothes, and you somehow end up with grease stains in places they have no business being. For all his apparent poise, Lan Xichen is no exception.</p><p>The ink smeared on his fingers has long since been replaced with burnt-black oil that refuses to come out no matter how many times the older man washes his hands. There are spots spattering his once-pristine white robes that Jiang Cheng is pretty sure aren’t all water, and loose tendrils of his hair are sticking to his face, damp with perspiration. Lan Xichen is the First Jade of the Gusu Lan sect, used to looking perfect at all times (or at least, that’s what Jiang Cheng is allowing himself to think). Right now, he’s a mess, and he <em>still</em> looks the part of the lauded “most handsome bachelor in the cultivation world”.</p><p>It’s not fucking fair, is what it is. But the thought is lacking its usual bite, and the familiar spike of jealousy that sometimes – okay, usually – accompanies it just isn’t there.</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks down at himself. His clothes are just as disgusting, perhaps more so, but at least they’re not white, so the grime doesn’t show as much. That’s one thing about Gusu Lan sect robes: they’re so easy to get dirty. He has no idea how Lan Xichen keeps his so spotless all the time. Maybe it’s some sort of sect secret.</p><p>“I need a bath,” he mutters, wrinkling his nose.</p><p>That draws a laugh from the other man. “I would not be amiss to one myself.”</p><p>Lan Xichen still insists on walking him out, apologizing non-stop as he does so for putting Jiang Cheng through that disaster and promising never to do it again. Jiang Cheng snickers at him the whole way.</p><p>They say goodbye at the end of the garden, and Jiang Cheng makes the long walk back to the main portion of Cloud Recesses feeling lighter than he has in ages. Gods, he hasn’t laughed that hard since… he’s not sure, actually. Finally, he reaches the building where he’s been staying for the past three nights.</p><p>He really, <em>really</em> wants a bath, but he made Jin Ling promise to have dinner with him, and the sun’s already starting to go down. A dark blue cast is slowly sweeping over the sky; a few of the younger disciples are lighting the lanterns that line the walkways for people to see by. As much as Jiang Cheng might want to skip out on this right now in favour of getting cleaned up, it’s been too long since he had a proper talk with his nephew, and he doesn’t want that to continue. He’s also still hungry.</p><p>Quickening his steps, Jiang Cheng heads to the corridor where both their rooms are located. He bypasses his own quarters and knocks on Jin Ling’s instead, hoping that the boy is inside so they can get this over with.</p><p>No such luck. Only silence answers, and Jiang Cheng curses under his breath. The brat’s not home. There’s no surprise there – he’s probably off somewhere with Lan Sizhui, maybe the other obnoxious Lan kid as well. Honestly, Jiang Cheng should have seen this coming.</p><p><em>Damn it</em>. This is going to be tough. He’s going to have to <em>find </em>Jin Ling. And as he knows from experience, his nephew is very, very good at disappearing when he needs to. <em>Fuck</em>.</p>

        <blockquote class="userstuff">
          <p>Hey everybody, I'm back with a new chapter! It's been three days, and fake-orientation has been eating up so much of my time, so today I just said 'heck it' and finished up these two thousand words. The style's a little weird - I didn't think it through as much as I probably should have, and honestly I'd intended to just gloss over this bit as a fun little paragraph, but I am, by nature, not very succinct. As you can probably tell.</p><p>In every single one of my Chinese compositions last year, my teacher told me to stop being so 啰嗦 (aka. long-winded). If you're familiar with the practice of writing Chinese compositions, consider this: the first one I took home to write in January - about 共享脚踏车计划 (the public bike-sharing program thing we've got going on in Singapore right now) - was nine pages long. NINE. Almost all of it redundant. Needless to say, I did not do very well for that essay. (Thinking about it now, it's actually kind of a miracle I managed to pass Chinese for ten years.)</p><p>Anyway, I should probably stop talking about myself. Back to the story. So, this was supposed to be pretty short, but it grew into a whole chapter by itself. I hope you don't mind - I left it like this because I felt like writing some fluff after the whole angst-fest of the past few chapters. If you don't like it, I can always edit a little.</p><p>By the way, I've been thinking of a new fic idea. Yes, again. As always, I don't really have the time or energy to write this myself, but if anyone wants to take it up, please do. Here you go.</p><p>XiCheng Modern AU (yes, another one):<br/>It's nineteen ninety-seven, and Yiling is a rising star at the heart of Southeast Asia. Its economy is growing, and it's developing into a more of a shining metropolis by the day, but it's still a tiny island state in the middle of nowhere.<br/>Not exactly the place Yunmeng native Jiang Cheng - also known as Jiang Wanyin - thought he'd be spending his late twenties. But he's coming off a bad breakup after he caught his girlfriend of a year cheating, and sue him, he needs to get away from home for a little while. So when his company asks if anyone's interested in staffing the new branch opening up in Yiling, Jiang Cheng says yes.<br/>Lan Huan - Lan Xichen to everyone except his family and close friends - has been living and working in Yunmeng for nearly six years now, after packing up and moving from his home in Gusu halfway across the world. If you asked him, he might say he's doing pretty well for himself. Especially when his boss resigns, and Lan Huan is the one assigned his job. There's only one catch: he has to move again.<br/>Life throws people together all the time, and often when they part, they're still just as foreign to each other as before. When Jiang Cheng and Lan Huan, two perfect strangers, sit down next to each other on the flight from Yunmeng to Yiling, they're all set to never meet again after they stand up and go their separate ways. But it takes four hours for a plane to make the journey, and it only takes a minute to change two people's worlds forever.</p><p>This fic idea is loosely based on the story of how my parents met, which I grew up hearing and always loved. I was talking to a friend today when I started on my family; one thing led to another, and then I spilled this story. My friend said it was like something straight out of a fanfic, and thus this thing was born. I'm kind of excited about it, actually. Who knows, maybe I'll find the time to write it. <br/>If you want to know how the real-life story went, you can ask me about it on Tumblr. My ask-box is always open.</p><p>As always, thanks for reading! Hope you enjoyed the chapter! I hope to have another one up tomorrow. :)</p>

    <p>As loud as Jin Ling is, one would think it would be relatively easy to find him. Unfortunately, as Jiang Cheng is rediscovering, that’s not the case. So far, he’s looked everywhere he can think of: the mess hall, the gardens, the training grounds – but the kid is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>He’s going to break his nephew’s fucking legs, he fumes as another Lan disciple he’s dragged over to question scurries away, looking furtively over his shoulder as though Jiang Cheng might suddenly sprout fangs and lunge after him. Jin Ling <em>swore</em> he’d be back for dinner, gods damn it; Jiang Cheng didn’t raise him to go back on his word like this. When Jiang Cheng finds the brat, he’s going to be dead meat.</p><p>The disgruntled sect leader rounds another corner and bumps right into Lan Jingyi, who for once isn’t tearing full-tilt along the corridors, but rather walking at a pace that is only slightly faster than sedate. Thank the heavens. Jiang Cheng has no desire to add being bowled over by an overexcited disciple to the list of things that have gone wrong today.</p><p>Said disciple jumps back at the collision, momentarily losing his grip on a frankly terrifying tower of books. The stack teeters, then falls like a great tree being cut down in a forest, and with a resounding crash, there are suddenly books all over the floor.</p><p>But when Lan Jingyi’s eyes finally flick upwards from where they were previously fixed on his books, he doesn’t even move to pick them up. Instead, he bows and stutters, “Se– Sect Leader Jiang,” then falls silent.</p><p>Jiang Cheng quirks an eyebrow, waiting for the kid to say something other than his title, which is so painfully obvious it barely counts as a comment at all. If anything, the small action seems to terrify him even more. Lan Jingyi shuffles his feet and blurts out a rushed apology for not looking where he was going, ducking his head with embarrassment.</p><p>It’s the second time Jiang Cheng has seen Jin Ling’s best friend number two in as many days. The first instance being the absolute wreck that was yesterday, when Jiang Cheng made a total fool out of himself in front of three teenagers, one of whom just so happened to be this one. And Lan Jingyi was definitely not this – well, for lack of a better word – meek yesterday. No, as Jiang Cheng found to his detriment, the kid had been a nightmare. A demon child straight out of the Ten Palaces of Hell, shamelessness on par with Wei Wuxian himself.</p><p>But now? Now, Lan Jingyi is blushing beetroot-red, on his hands and knees picking up the numerous books scattered on the ground, all while nattering on non-stop about both everything and nothing at the same time.</p><p>Everything, as in every topic under the sun, shuttled back and forth between so fast it might be giving Jiang Cheng whiplash. Nothing, in that none of it means anything at all useful. Not even a little.</p><p>Rambling. He’s rambling, and Jiang Cheng has interrogated enough people to recognize a diversionary tactic when he sees one. But then again, on second thought, Lan Jingyi doesn’t seem quite subtle enough for diversionary tactics. It’s much more likely that the young Lan disciple has done something, and is now feeling irretrievably guilty about it, and equally nervous that someone might find out what it is. Flinty gray eyes narrow at the thought.</p><p>Lan Jingyi is acting sketchy as all hell. He’s definitely hiding something.</p><p>He’s also still talking by the time he’s finally collected all his books into a massive, jumbled mess, cradling it in his arms as though it’s a newborn child instead of a pile of bound papers held together only by sheer willpower and the Gusu Lan clan’s prodigious arm strength.</p><p>“–wasn’t careful and I’m really, really sorry, Sect Leader Jiang!”, Lan Jingyi gushes hurriedly, apologetically. He bounces his books around, resettling them into a more comfortable position. Then he gives another bow, back straight and head dipping past his waist, as is only proper when addressing the leader of another sect. “I’ll, uh, just be going now.”</p><p>He flashes a grin that peels back his lips, revealing all his teeth. Another red flag. Jiang Cheng grew up in a family of smiling people; he knows how to spot a fake grin when he sees one.</p><p>He could stop Lan Jingyi and question him if he wanted to, maybe give the boy his best icy glare until he cracks and spills the beans. But he’s obviously got somewhere else he needs to be – the books are a testament to that, thick and heavy and looking like they weigh more than he does – and anyway, Jiang Cheng has more important things on his mind.</p><p>“Not so fast,” he says, just as Lan Jingyi looks about to beat a hasty retreat. The disciple’s eyes widen and he clutches his books tighter to himself. By the gods. Jiang Cheng isn’t going to <em>attack</em> the kid. Why is he looking at Jiang Cheng like that? “Where’s Jin Ling? Have you seen him?”</p><p>“I think– I think he might be at the cold springs.”</p><p>The reply comes stammering and uncertain, and Lan Jingyi practically runs away when Jiang Cheng waves a hand at him in a dismissive gesture. <em>I think he might</em>. Could he get any less specific? Well, it’s something at least, which is better than nothing.</p><p>Jiang Cheng sets off for the cold springs.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Even though the last time he stayed in Cloud Recesses for longer than two days was over a decade and a half ago, Jiang Cheng has always had a pretty decent memory. It therefore stands to reason that he’s also rather confident in his ability to remember where everything is, and from there, find his way around. Well, he <em>was</em>, at least.</p><p>The cold springs seem to be the one exception to this rule. Which is understandable, as it was one of the few places in Cloud Recesses that Jiang Cheng never visited as a disciple. It was more or less an unspoken rule – there were surprisingly few of those, since most of the rules were explicitly stated, if not written down – that only Gusu Lan sect members used the cold springs. Or, it definitely seemed like it. The alternative would be that no one else could stand the frigid water, which was also a distinct possibility.</p><p>Like almost all of the other rules in Cloud Recesses, this unspoken one was also one that Wei Wuxian broke. He’d confided to Jiang Cheng that it was exactly as everyone said: fucking freezing, and that was that. But Jiang Cheng isn’t thinking about that right now.</p><p>The point here is that even with his near-perfect memory of the layout of this infernal place, the fact remains that he cannot find his way to somewhere he’s never been before. Basic logic, really. Although Jiang Cheng has never been one to allow himself to be led by something so trivial.</p><p>He wanders around the maze that is Cloud Recesses for a good fifteen minutes, without any clear idea of where he’s going or how to get there. Of course, there are disciples milling around in the corridors, any one of whom could, and would, probably provide this information if asked. But again, of course, Jiang Cheng doesn’t do that.</p><p>No, far be it for him to ask anyone for <em>directions</em>. His little mental voice snarks at him from some cozy corner on the inside of his head, but he’s gotten good at ignoring it. Ignoring himself. Whatever.</p><p><em>Stubborn asshole</em>, it chides. <em>Should have asked the Lan disaster when you had the chance.</em></p><p>Another voice speaks up. <em>That’s mean. Don’t call the poor kid that</em>. It sounds suspiciously like Wei Wuxian’s pet zombie, Wen Qiong-something-or-other, soft and meek and impossibly heart-eyed. Jiang Cheng tamps down the anger that threatens to rise within him at the memory of the Wen man, eyes red, heavy iron chains clanking at his wrists, black veins snaking across his skin.</p><p>Great. He’s losing control of his own mind. Even the voices in it are people he hates. Fan-fucking-tastic.</p><p>He keeps walking.</p><p>Finally, his efforts are rewarded when he turns a corner and trees appear in front of him instead of white stone walls, tall and wide and green. The path he’s on cuts between two of them; he follows it, raising a hand to push a particularly low branch out of the way.</p><p>Unlike the buildings of the main complex, there are no lanterns to drive away the darkness in this area. The only light comes from the moon, silvery and unexpectedly bright, and through the thick plant growth, a reflective shimmer to Jiang Cheng’s left tells him where the springs are. He follows it, his footsteps near silent even here, where dry fallen twigs and crunchy dead leaves abound.</p><p>Despite that, it’s nowhere near quiet. Sound springs up all around: the chirping of cicadas, the soft lapping noise of water, and the background whisper of the wind in the leaves.</p><p>There’s nobody here. Obviously Lan Jingyi gave him false information. Jiang Cheng wants to smack the kid for wasting his time. He has better things to do than traipse around in some pseudo-forest on a wild goose chase, searching for someone who wasn’t even there in the first place.</p><p>He’s about to turn back, when suddenly, he hears hushed voices drifting through the trees. Human voices. They’re too soft for him to make out anything that’s being said, but Jiang Cheng recognizes the distinct cadence and timbre of the one that belongs to his nephew.</p><p><em>Oh</em>, he thinks. <em>Lan Jingyi was right</em>. His irritation towards the teenage Lan disciple abates slightly, only to be redirected towards Jin Ling. Night has long since fallen – it’s well past the time his nephew said he’d be back. But instead, he’s out <em>here</em>. In the leafy-ass end of nowhere, where Jiang Cheng now is because Jin Ling couldn’t be <em>bothered</em> to keep his word.</p><p>So, yeah, one might say that the leader of the Yunmeng Jiang sect is a teeny, tiny, miniscule little bit pissed.</p><p>He stalks through the trees, silent as a wraith and raging like an angry spirit, ready to give his nephew a piece of his mind. Maybe break the brat’s legs. Or chew him out to kingdom come. Jiang Cheng isn’t picky.</p><p>But as he emerges from the last line of trees, the moonlight striking the rippling surface of the water reveals a sight that stops him short. Oh, yes, he’s found the cold springs. And he’s <em>definitely</em> found Jin Ling.</p><p>Two figures are pressed up against the willow tree near the edge of the pool. Or rather, one figure is pressing another up against the tree trunk, the other clinging to them, back flat against the wood. The top halves of their robes are pushed down, bunched around their hips, and in the dim, silver light, Jiang Cheng can barely make out white and gold – the latter belonging to the smaller figure, the one pushed up against the tree.</p><p><em>Oh, fuck</em>. Jiang Cheng’s heart stops in his chest.</p><p>That’s his gods-damn nephew, sucking face with Lan Wangji’s son, who is currently running his fucking <em>hands</em> all over Jin Ling’s bare chest, both of them clothed only from the waist down. Now that Jiang Cheng knows what’s going on, the forest suddenly seems much quieter than before, and he can <em>hear</em> the utterly indecent noises coming out of both their mouths, assaulting his ears and turning his face what he’s pretty sure is an appalling shade of mauve.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has spent years of his comparatively short life raising this kid. He’s changed Jin Ling’s diapers, dodged projectile vomit and nearly been impaled several times over the course of his early archery training. That, he could handle. That was all part of rearing children – not the child he fathered, though his nonetheless.</p><p>But this? Jiang Cheng most emphatically did <em>not</em> sign up for this.</p><p>Then Jin Ling makes a noise that sounds like a dying cat and brings his leg up to hook around Lan Sizhui’s waist, and <em>hell no,</em> Jiang Cheng is not watching this. No fucking way.</p><p>Resisting the urge to cover his eyes and run away, he grits his teeth. Makes his footsteps heavier as he strides forward, deliberately stepping on a few twigs just to hear them crack. The two teenagers jump apart at the sudden noise.</p><p>Jiang Cheng can see the exact moment they finally notice he’s there. Jin Ling’s eyes go wide and he shoots up, pushing off the tree he’s been leaning on to stand upright. Only he overestimates the force involved and pitches too far forward. He stumbles, and Lan Sizhui grabs his arm to make sure he doesn’t fall.</p><p>Both of them scramble to pull their robes back on, attempting to return themselves to at least some semblance of propriety. As Lan Sizhui hikes his sleeve back over his shoulder, Jiang Cheng catches a glimpse of a dark splotch on his collarbone, in the shape of a four-pointed star. Then the young disciple pulls his robes closed, and the mark disappears again.</p><p>“What in the eighteen levels of hell are the two of you doing?”</p>

    <p>There are times that Jin Ling appreciates being alive, despite all the complaints he spouts to the contrary. Moments like petting Fairy, shooting a fierce corpse right through the eye, kissing Sizhui in the moonlight. It’s the little things. But right now, all he wants is to crawl into a nice, damp cave somewhere and die. Preferably far, far away from his uncle.</p><p>His uncle who is currently glaring at him, jaw clenched and arms folded across his chest, demanding an explanation. Jin Ling’s blood turns to ice in his veins, the pleasant thrumming warmth from the feeling of Sizhui’s strong hands on his skin dying a cold and painful death. He is acutely aware of his disheveled state, hair mussed and robes loose, and the fact that his uncle <em>must</em>, at some point, have seen him bare-chested and practically groping another disciple.</p><p>Fuck. This is shaping up to be the worst night of Jin Ling’s life.</p><p>What is his uncle even doing here, anyway? The two of them picked this spot <em>specifically</em> so no one would show up. Sizhui had said that no one besides the Gusu Lan disciples used the cold springs, and anyway, it was too early in the spring for even them. Also, Jin Ling doesn’t have to be back til–</p><p><em>Oh</em>, he thinks faintly as realisation washes over him. <em>Oh, no</em>. He takes back everything he thought before. This whole situation just got a hundred times worse.</p><p>No wonder his uncle is angry. Actually, from the look on his face right now, ‘angry’ doesn’t even begin to describe it. He looks <em>furious</em>, and it’s all Jin Ling’s fault because he’d promised to be back in time for dinner and then didn’t show up, and when his uncle went looking for him, he found– he found…</p><p>The last shred of self-preservation remaining in Jin Ling’s brain tells him not to finish that sentence. Though nothing in this world is enough to guarantee that Jin Ling will still have his life – or all four limbs – intact when this is over.</p><p>Holy shit. His uncle is going to murder him. If he doesn’t die of shame first.</p><p>Oh, gods. The tips of Jin Ling’s ears heat as he remembers all the embarrassing noises that had spilled from his lips, how he’d let Sizhui push him up against the tree and kiss him stupid. Did his uncle really see everything?</p><p>A terrible, horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach tells Jin Ling that yes, he did.</p><p>Next to him, Sizhui smiles weakly. “Good evening, Sect Leader Jiang.”</p><p>Good evening? <em>Good fucking evening?</em> That’s Sizhui’s response to the famously ill-tempered Sandu-Shengshou’s legendary death glare? Jin Ling can’t tell whether it’s exceedingly brave or very, very foolish. Possibly both. He loves his boyfriend, he really does, but sometimes he questions Sizhui’s sanity. That much close proximity to Wei Wuxian must have some sort of undocumented long-term impact on the brain.</p><p>His uncle’s stony gaze flicks from Jin Ling to Sizhui next to him, who squirms a little under the weight of that intense stare. Jin Ling feels a bit like a pig that has been taken off the spitroast after hours of being slow-cooked over a blazing fire, only to watch its neighbour meet the same fate.</p><p>“It’s not,” his uncle snaps irritably. “I won’t ask again: <em>what</em> are the two of you doing? I came all the way out here to find you, Jin Ling, you better give me a fucking excellent explanation.”</p><p>Now, Jin Ling is a far cry from the tiny child he used to be – in fact, he’s shot up nearly four inches in the past year alone, putting him at only a little more than an inch shorter than his uncle – but the leader of the Yunmeng Jiang sect is fucking <em>terrifying</em> when he gets like this, as Jin Ling well knows. So he has no qualms about admitting that he’s nearly shaking in his boots.</p><p>His mouth goes dry, tongue tying itself in knots. He wants to shake his head in answer, seeing as he can’t get anything out in the way of words, but he knows that would be even worse than saying nothing at all.</p><p>Surprisingly, it’s Sizhui who answers. Or perhaps not so surprising, seeing as he seems to be labouring under the delusion that Jin Ling’s uncle actually <em>likes </em>him, which is complete and utter bullshit. “We… we were…”</p><p><em>Damn it, Sizhui. That’s not an answer</em>. Jin Ling resists the urge to bury his face in his hands and pretend he’s invisible.</p><p>“Yes? Out with it.”</p><p>It’s painfully obvious that Sizhui has no idea what to say next. He’s struggling, fumbling with his words, and there’s a very scary fully-grown adult male cultivator glaring down at him like some sort of pissed-off god of death. A stormy look on his face that says <em>who is this little shit, and why does he think he can defile my nephew?</em></p><p>As much as Jin Ling wants to stay out of this conversation (that looks more like an impending massacre), as said nephew, this isn’t something he can sit out. He has obligations, and he can’t exactly abandon his boyfriend to suffer his uncle’s wrath alone.</p><p>Swallowing a few times, he gathers up the nerve to speak. “We were, uh, wrestling.”</p><p>The moment the words are out of his mouth, he wishes he’d listened when his instincts told him to shut up. <em>Really? That’s the best you can do?</em> His uncle clearly thinks the same way, as his eyebrow nearly disappears into his hairline.</p><p>“With your mouths?”</p><p>Jin Ling hates it when his uncle gets sarcastic. It makes it <em>so</em> much harder to argue with him, because he can’t even resort to his usual tactics of defensive yelling and blustering until his uncle starts yelling back. Meanwhile, Sizhui turns to look at him, face carefully blank. Despite the lack of expression, Jin Ling knows that look. It’s his <em>nice going, dumbass</em> face – the one he uses when either Jin Ling or Jingyi does something stupid, and he has to pull them out of the fire. Well, Jin Ling doesn’t see him coming up with any better ideas.</p><p>“Uh… yes?”, he responds. The hole is dug, the coffin prepared. Now he just has to lie down and wait for death to take him.</p><p>But his uncle just gives a snort of disgust. “No shame, any of you,” he mutters, almost to himself. “All of my family members. Every single fucking one.”</p><p>Jin Ling can’t help but wince. He knows who else <em>that </em>refers to. And it’s a bad day indeed when his uncle compares him to Wei Wuxian.</p><p>Then, louder, the older man continues, his voice taking on a steely note. “I’m not an idiot, boy. I didn’t raise you to be one, either. Now, would you care to tell me exactly <em>why</em> you are out here, after dark, in the middle of nowhere, instead of back in the main buildings where you’re <em>supposed to be?</em>”</p><p>Jin Ling opens his mouth – frankly, without a clue as to what the proper response would be – but his uncle doesn’t even let him answer. He addresses Sizhui instead, expression hardening like diamond.</p><p>“And you. You’re supposed to be the responsible one. Eighteen now, is it?” He holds Sizhui’s gaze until the older boy nods slowly. “Hm. An adult. Act like it.”</p><p>A mutinous feeling wells up in Jin Ling. <em>That’s hardly fair</em>, he wants to retort. <em>It wasn’t Sizhui’s fault I didn’t make curfew. He’s not even from your sect – you can’t yell at him</em>. But he tamps it down and traps it in his throat. Because the thing is: he <em>can</em>.</p><p>Though Sizhui is a Gusu Lan disciple, he’s also courting Jin Ling, and that puts Jin Ling’s uncle, as his guardian, within his rights to say almost anything he wants to his nephew’s boyfriend.</p><p>Said man looks Jin Ling in the face, eyes glittering and piercing even in the soft light cast by the moon, as if daring him to argue. And Jin Ling knows immediately that he is totally, irrevocably fucked.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hours later, back in his rooms, Jiang Cheng flops onto the bed with a sigh. The paperwork he’s been ignoring all day is piled ominously on his desk, as if threatening to multiply and crush him in his sleep. But he keeps on ignoring it. It will still be there tomorrow anyway, and he deserves a break after the day he’s had.</p><p>Gods, his head hurts. He closes his eyes, turns onto his side, as though that will quell the pounding between his temples. It doesn’t.</p><p>In the next room over, Jin Ling isn’t making any noise, even through the thin wall. Jiang Cheng doesn’t know whether to be grateful for his nephew’s uncharacteristic lack of noise, or guilty.</p><p>Back at the cold springs, he’d scolded the boy. He’d scolded the two of them, in fact – both Jin Ling and his technically-adult boyfriend. It wasn’t unusual, per say; Jiang Cheng has been chewing Jin Ling out for his misdemeanours ever since the brat could understand words (and admittedly, a bit before that, too). This time wasn’t even particularly severe, considering he didn’t make Jin Ling cry, which hasn’t happened in years.</p><p>Still, Jiang Cheng can’t stop thinking about Jin Ling’s subdued demeanor – his slumped shoulders and shuffled footsteps – when Jiang Cheng marched him back to his rooms in the visiting sect leaders’ building. About his nephew’s sullen silence when he informed him in no uncertain terms that he was grounded until further notice. <em>Until you can prove to me that you are trustworthy</em>, he’d said.</p><p>It was the right thing to do, he thinks. Jin Ling went back on his word, showed himself to be incapable of keeping the promises he makes, even something as simple as this. How is he going to earn and hold the faith of other cultivators, other sect leaders, if he can’t even adhere to a curfew?</p><p>This is for his own good.</p><p>But the low hum of the voice in the back of his mind tells him otherwise. It’s getting more vocal these days, doubting his every move, his every word and action. This time, it whispers that Jin Ling is sixteen now, almost seventeen. Almost a man.</p><p><em>You can’t keep treating him like a child</em>, it says. <em>One day, he’s going to start resenting you</em>. Its voice is slimy, oozing across the surface of his thoughts and coating everything with an oily black sheen. <em>Hell, maybe he already does.</em></p><p>Jin Ling is a child, he protests automatically. A child who’s been through too much already – his parents dead, replaced by a mess of a man who shouldn’t even be allowed around other human beings – but still a child. Still young, and sheltered from most of the horrors of the real world. Jealousy. War. Greed. Things Jiang Cheng looked in the eye, ran with and against when he was barely older than Jin Ling is now.</p><p>Is it any wonder that he wants to shield his nephew from it all?</p><p><em>He won’t see it that way</em>, hisses the voice. <em>You can’t even admit it to yourself, can you? This isn’t about that. About wanting to protect him, and all that shit you love to spout to yourself to make you feel better. It’s not about him, the way you like to pretend it is.</em></p><p>
  <em>It’s about you. You, and all the ways you’re fucked in the head.</em>
</p><p>Jiang Cheng wants to tell it to shut up. To pull the covers over his head and clap his hands over his ears so he can block out the slithery sounds of the awful words it keeps saying. But he can’t because it’s in his head.</p><p>It’s in <em>him</em>. It’s his own mind, and it’s true.</p><p><em>He’s going to hate you</em>, the voice continues, heedless of Jiang Cheng’s efforts to silence it. <em>When he’s grown, he’s going to walk away, just like everyone else. And it’ll be because you pushed him there.</em></p>

          <p>GAH what even is this chapter?! The mood changed so wildly after the line break, I don't even know. But anyway, here you go - a new chapter, as promised. Of course I had to add some JC angst in there; we've gone too long without it.</p><p>Just to clarify: JL doesn't actually hate JC. This is all in his head, a manifestation of his constant anxiety that he'll never be good enough for anyone, and his belief that he drives everyone he loves away. Here, JL is just a little bit of an exasperated teenager who's been caught out by their guardian and is getting punished for it - he's not happy about it, but well, he did kind of bring it upon himself. But JC is interpreting this in what is probably a pretty bad way, because of the issues he has with communication and other things. This is also what I hope is a look at how he operates as a parental figure: someone who has no idea what he's doing and is just bumbling along in a rather belligerent manner, while also getting very worried that the efforts he's making aren't enough. I hope this is in-character for him. If it's not, please tell me so I can edit.</p><p>Today's song recommendation is Taylor Swift's 'Mine', mostly because I think it's a cute, upbeat song that might possibly fit a modern-day Xicheng. And we all know I'm a sucker for modern AUs.</p><p>Anyway, catch y'all next time! Thank you to everyone who's been reading, reviewing and leaving kudos. I love you guys! :) &lt;3</p><p>(Don't worry, we're going to get our Yunmeng Duo reconciliation soon. Hooray!!!!)</p>

    <p>The next morning goes much the same as the ones before it, the meeting running smoothly. There is a distinct lack of death threats, which is always a plus, and the three hours come to an end without any major disruptions. It’s as bland as a day could possibly be, and for once, Jiang Cheng is thankful for the lack of excitement after all the tumult of the day before.</p><p>The only thing that puts a damper on the calm, easy mood is that Jin Ling is avoiding him. His nephew is already absent from his quarters when Jiang Cheng comes by to wake him up, bed made messily and boots gone from their place by the doorway. He’s seated at the pavilion before Jiang Cheng arrives, and discreetly doesn’t make eye contact with his uncle during the meeting itself. Afterwards, he scurries off again, presumably back to his rooms, where Jiang Cheng ordered him to remain last night.</p><p>It’s not obvious, but the way Jin Ling ducks his head, gaze sliding away from his uncle’s as he retreats in the opposite direction makes Jiang Cheng’s heart ache. He tries to snap out of it by attempting to convince himself that the kid is just awkward, embarrassed about last night, but the black mood has sunk its claws into his skin and refuses to let go.</p><p>It hangs about him like a shroud; he flares up at the smallest things, the fire rising in him at the barest provocation. Even the disciples can tell that something is amiss. They jump out of his way as he stalks through the corridors, scattering like rice grain spilled onto the floor, and don’t stop to greet him. He’s fine with that. It’s not like his existence needs acknowledgement from boys barely halfway through puberty.</p><p>He knows who he is, thank you very much, his name and his title, and he doesn’t need them parroted back to him ten consecutive times as though delivering some novel information.</p><p>All the same, his skin prickles and itches with a feeling he can’t name. And behind all that is an urge to say something, do something, go somewhere – a tiny cottage in the far recesses of this white-walled hellhole, because the rest of it is driving him fucking insane. He wants – gods, he can barely admit this to himself – but he wants to see Lan Xichen. To talk to him, because for some reason, the other man feels <em>safe</em>, in a way that Jiang Cheng hasn’t felt in a long while.</p><p>Like he doesn’t have to be angry all the time. And right now, he wants that so badly his hands are shaking with it.</p><p>His head feels full, buzzing with thoughts he can’t control. He attempts to shake them off and clear his mind; it works only partially – they slide back, just under the surface, a low hum instead of a roar but there all the same. He keeps walking.</p><p>The route to the part of Cloud Recesses reserved for cultivators in seclusion takes Jiang Cheng past most of the main buildings and through the training yard, which at this time of day, is packed with disciples. Instructors, too, leading them in exercises to improve their forms and movements.</p><p>Jiang Cheng remembers those drills, those days where he stood in the courtyard for hours on end, getting his technique corrected and his stance picked apart. He doesn’t miss them at all.</p><p>Soon, the quadrangle and everyone in it vanish from view. The path turns another corner, taking Jiang Cheng between two of the buildings reserved for lessons, and suddenly, a figure appears in the middle of the stone track.</p><p>Black and red. That’s the first thing that Jiang Cheng registers about the person standing in front of him. Their robes, dark like the night, and the colour of their belt and sleeves, a bright red that stands out and screams <em>look at me</em>. Commands attention and holds it, and its fitting because that’s what this person does best.</p><p>Jiang Cheng stops dead. His breath catches in his throat, and hidden within the wide sleeves of his robes, his hands clench into fists.</p><p>It’s Wei Wuxian.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“H-how have you been?” Wei Wuxian shifts awkwardly, voice cracking on the ‘how’. He looks like <em>shit</em>, circles under his eyes so large and dark that for a moment, Jiang Cheng is reminded of the moment he’d seen him back for the first time, newly shoved into Mo Xuanyu’s body, face caked in makeup that made him look like the madman his host had been. Pale, too, like he hasn’t slept in ages, maybe since the argument.</p><p>Gods. Did he do that? Did he hurt his brother that much?</p><p>Who is he kidding; of fucking course he did. That’s what Jiang Cheng does, after all – hurts people – and Wei Wuxian has always been too damn selfless for his own good. Has always taken everything to heart, shouldered everyone’s pain and suffering and made it his own so no one else has to feel it.</p><p>It’s one of the reasons Jiang Cheng’s always hated him. (And loved him, too.)</p><p>He clasps his hands behind his back, squaring his shoulders as though he’s about to go into battle. “Fine.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian breathes out at that, a hiss of air that Jiang Cheng can’t figure out the meaning of. “That’s good.” It comes out like a croak. There’s a flash of something in his eyes and Jiang Cheng can’t read that either, and it sends a lance of pain shooting into his lungs because he used to be able to look at his big brother and see <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Now, he wears a stranger’s face, makes unfamiliar expressions and feels so fucking far away, but he still talks like Jiang Cheng’s big brother and smiles like him too, and it makes everything sting just that little bit more.</p><p>Pain – pain is all right, though. He knows how to deal with pain, has since before he can remember. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a broken limb or a wound no one else can see: the principle is the same. You ice it until it goes numb, and then you push on and keep going.</p><p>He does that now, lets his voice frost over like the surface of a lake in the dead of winter, cold calm settling over him. “You knew that already,” he says flatly. “You’ve been following me.”</p><p>And it’s true, he realises, even as the words leave his mouth. The whirl of black and red at the corner of his eye two days before, so quick he thought he’d imagined it. And yesterday, the way the other man positioned himself at the mouth of the pavilion, only to flee like a startled cat once Jiang Cheng showed up.</p><p>Wei Wuxian flinches. “Jiang Cheng, I–”</p><p>He stops. Jiang Cheng waits for him to say more, but he doesn’t, and that’s okay, because Jiang Cheng doesn’t think he’d be able to hear it anyway. Instead, Wei Wuxian’s words cycle around and around in his head, echoing and reverberating until there’s nothing else except the sound of them ringing in his ears.</p><p><em>Jiang Cheng. </em>His stomach unclenches, his knees going slightly weak with relief. Still his name. His birth one, not the one the rest of the world calls him, not a title, or a courtesy. Not the one that Wei Wuxian hurled at him in anger a mere three days ago, that cut into his skin and hollowed out his insides. Just his name – the name his brother has called him by since they were ten years old.</p><p>It’s stupid, that something as small and silly as being called the right name can make everything feel better, steadier, can make the world stop spinning – or at least slow down – for a little while. Jiang Cheng started calling his older brother by his courtesy name when he first received it, after all; yet when it was Jiang Cheng’s turn, Wei Wuxian said <em>fuck that</em> and went right on with his birth one, disregarding all the norms and rules of etiquette that said otherwise. And though Jiang Cheng protested for months afterwards, he didn’t really mind as much as he pretended to.</p><p>Hearing it again now, it’s grounding. <em>Safe</em>. As though maybe – just maybe – there might be hope for them.</p><p>(Gods, does he hope so.)</p><p>Finally, Wei Wuxian looks up again. The corners of his mouth twitch as though he’s attempting to muster up a weak smile, and not quite succeeding. “I have been following you.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“It’s just, the argument– these past three days have been the shittiest I’ve felt in a long time,” he admits, and it feels like a confession. “I had to make sure you were okay. I didn’t want– I couldn’t leave things like that. Not with you. Us.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng can’t help the sharp intake of breath that follows. He doesn’t know how to feel, to respond to this. He hadn’t wanted it either, hadn’t wanted to leave with the air still soured between them, thick with anger and shouted words they hadn’t meant to say but had still <em>meant</em>. Yet he’d resigned himself to it anyway, because that’s what they do: they hurt each other and then they bury it under the rest of their gods-damned baggage and pretend it never happened.</p><p>“Why?”, he asks again. He can see by the way the older man’s eyebrows crease that he doesn’t understand. “This–” he gestures between them – “isn’t something we do. I yell at you, you yell at me, and it ends there. We don’t sit around in a circle and talk about our <em>feelings</em>.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, maybe we should. Maybe we should start changing the way we do things, because I’m fucking sick of the way things are.” Wei Wuxian raises his chin, meeting Jiang Cheng’s eyes. “Look at us. We haven’t even really talked to each other in years.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s mouth goes dry. His fingers itch for Zidian, and he starts to feel as though he’s being backed into a corner. Helpless. He doesn’t want to talk – not now, not about this, not with <em>him</em>.</p><p>“Where’s Hanguang-Jun?” He changes the subject clumsily, trying for an icy tone. It doesn’t work; his desperation is too obvious. “He must be looking for you.”</p><p>“Don’t do this, Jiang Cheng. It’s not going to work. We’re having this conversation.”</p><p>He recognizes this voice. It’s Wei Wuxian’s big-brother voice, the one he used to use on the very rare occasions that Jiang Cheng had done something stupid, and <em>he</em> was playing the responsible one. Jiang Cheng hasn’t heard it in years. Irritation flickers in his stomach, and he latches onto it, fans the flames to try to get it to burn higher.</p><p>He scowls. “Fine, then. Say what you want to say, and leave.”</p><p>“Jiang Cheng, please–”</p><p>“You said you wanted to talk. Go ahead. Talk.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s face falls, disappointment etching itself into the lines in his face. He fiddls with the end of his ponytail. It’s a terrible habit; one he refuses to get rid of. “I–” he breaks off again, as though his words are failing him. Then he takes a deep breath, and starts over.</p><p>“I’m sorry for everything I said, alright? And maybe you don’t give a shit – maybe my opinion doesn’t mean anything to you – but I said some pretty awful things. And they weren’t right, not at all.”</p><p>It sounds stilted, unnatural; like the older man is dragging each syllable out from his throat to lay them bare in the space between the two of them. Jiang Cheng listens in stoic silence.</p><p>“After everything, after Lan Zhan pulled me away, I had time to think about everything I’d said to you. And you know what? The moment I got my head back, the moment I could think clearly again, I regretted it. Because none of it was true. You’re not a monster, Jiang Cheng. You’re <em>not</em> – you <em>are</em> a whole person, and I was a fuckwit to say otherwise, or even think it.”</p><p>“And I know this doesn’t erase anything, but I’m sorry for going off like that and trying to hurt you. I’m so, so sorry.” Wei Wuxian twists a lock of hair around his finger. A sheepish gesture, but there’s nothing shy about the gaze he fixes on Jiang Cheng, steady and unwavering. “There; now I’ve said it. Just like you wanted.”</p><p>There is guilt in his eyes. Shame. He’s doing it again, Jiang Cheng thinks, taking all the blame and responsibility and shifting them onto himself. Such a fucking martyr, even now. It used to piss Jiang Cheng off, used to make his blood boil because Wei Wuxian always had to be so noble, so selfless, so gods-damned <em>heroic</em>. Just a year ago, he would have been fuming, would have lost his temper by now and kick-started another shouting match. Another argument that would have ended in screaming and insults just as bad as last time, maybe worse.</p><p>But something’s changed since then. Jiang Cheng isn’t as angry as he used to be. He can’t find the fury, can’t stoke the embers into a towering inferno the way he used to. Instead, he’s just tired.</p><p>Gods, he’s so fucking tired.</p><p>“I don’t want to fight anymore.” And then he freezes, because that’s not what he was going to say. Wei Wuxian, though, straightens up. Quits twirling his hair around his finger. “Look – it’s not just your fault; it’s mine as well.”</p><p>When his older brother looks like he’s about to protest, Jiang Cheng raises a hand to cut him off. “That much is true, at least. I started it, so I’m partly to blame for what happened when you continued it.” He rubs the hand over his face. “I said my fair share of shit, so don’t pretend like it was all you and your dumbass hero complex.”</p><p>“But for what it’s worth, I’m sorry too.” And Jiang Cheng means it. Of course; he never says things he doesn’t mean. But he never says <em>all</em> of what he means, either, and that’s one of the reasons he’s such a fucking mess. “You’re not selfish–” (he’s always known that) – “or heartless–” (that’s almost laughable; if anything, Wei Wuxian has too <em>much </em>heart)</p><p>The other man’s cheeks slide slowly upwards, pulling his mouth into a small grin. “Immature?”, he asks slyly. Jiang Cheng can almost see the wink he’d give if they were sixteen again.</p><p>It’s not much of an olive branch. More like… the first blade of grass poking through the heavy crust of winter snow. It’s so delicate. So fragile. A tiny green thing, nearly lost amidst the sea of white, that might not even survive if this new spring proves false. If the cold returns to drown it again.</p><p>And in this moment, Jiang Cheng knows, deep in his bones, that they’ll never go back to the way things were. They’re not sixteen anymore, young and naïve and determined to follow each other to the ends of the earth, secure in their belief that nothing will ever tear them apart. Now, they’re so much older, and yet so little wiser, battle-hardened men clutching at the tangled threads of how everything used to be. It hurts, this loss of innocence, but Jiang Cheng hasn’t been innocent for a long time and neither has Wei Wuxian.</p><p>All that’s left is acknowledgement. Acceptance that time runs forwards, not backwards, and sometimes the seconds-minutes-<em>years</em> that slip through your fingers can never be gathered up again.</p><p>A long, long time ago, the two of them would sit at Ah-Jie’s feet and watch her sew. Occasionally, the string would get tangled – a mess of colour that knotted and looped and ran back over itself – and she wouldn’t be able to untie it. When that happened, she’d pull out a pair of scissors and say, in her soft voice like the first notes of a <em>xiao</em> on a warm summer morning, <em>sometimes the thread can’t be fixed, you see. Sometimes you have to cut it out, and start all over again.</em></p><p>It was never going to work, what they’ve been doing this past year. There’s too much shit between them, too much water running too fast to shore up the bridge already crumbling into hunks of driftwood. They can’t ignore it all forever, no matter how hard they try.</p><p>But maybe now, they can clear it all away and rebuild. It’s nowhere near perfect – in fact, far from it – but it’s something, at least. A little green leaf, living in spite of all the death that surrounds it.</p><p>“You’re pretty fucking immature,” Jiang Cheng replies. And then he smiles.</p><p> </p>

          <p>So here we are, guys, gals and non-binary pals (I think James Charles said this first, I'm not sure) - the Yunmeng Duo reconciliation I have been avoiding for a month!!!! *Cheers* I'm sorry this took so long; WWX is the hardest character for me to write for some reason, even though he's the main character in the novel. I just can't get into his headspace very well, so I apologise if either/both of these two are out-of-character. Again, this was REALLY DIFFICULT. I'm not all that happy with this chapter, to be honest, but at least it's done now, and two of our favourite brothers can finally start talking to each other again.</p><p>I'm hoping to get another chapter out before 初一, which will be Happy Lunar New Year to everyone who celebrates it, and happy holidays to everyone who doesn't but lives in a country where it is a public holiday, but this is just a tentative thing. We'll see how it goes. Thank you to everyone who's been sticking with this fic for so long. You are amazing!! &lt;3</p><p>This chapter's song is a toss-up between Linkin Park's 'Castle of Glass' and Ava Max's 'Sweet But Psycho', both of which I think are pretty good JC songs. Please give them a listen! Anyway, that's all for now, folks!</p>

    <p>“You’ve changed,” Wei Wuxian says later. He’s dragged Jiang Cheng back to the main building complex – against his will – and they’re now sitting in the living room of Hanguang-Jun’s <em>jingshi</em>, eating the incredibly bland food that the older man had brought up from the kitchens for lunch. The (currently absent) Second Jade of the Lan sect will undoubtedly be pissed as all hell to discover that Jiang Cheng was in his living quarters, but Jiang Cheng frankly doesn’t give a shit.</p><p>In fact, it adds a sort of spice to the whole encounter. Riling up Wei Wuxian’s stone-faced husband is an art form; one Jiang Cheng is a master of. Not to mention that this was all Wei Wuxian’s idea anyway.</p><p>Jiang Cheng swallows the steamed cabbage he’d put in his mouth prior to his older brother’s statement. Thank fucking gods they ordered in – Wei Wuxian’s cooking deserves its own circle of hell. His eyes narrow.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Even as he finishes chewing, the corners of the other man’s mouth twitch. “It’s hard to put my finger on it,” he admits, “but something’s definitely different about you. You’re – I don’t know – you’re less… snappy.”</p><p>“Snappy?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he replies, gesturing with his chopsticks. It’s incredibly rude, but such a <em>Wei Wuxian</em> thing to do that Jiang Cheng lets it slide. “You’re calmer or something. I can’t really explain it, but it’s like you’re not as angry all the time.”</p><p>“You’re imagining things,” Jiang Cheng retorts. A grin spreads across Wei Wuxian’s face. It’s… almost knowing. Which is ridiculous. Wei Wuxian doesn’t know anything. About anything.</p><p>“I’m not imagining things.”</p><p>“Yes, you are.”</p><p>“Am not.”</p><p>“What are you – eight? You’re such a fucking child,” Jiang Cheng retorts. He refuses to let this display of immature dumbassery go on any longer. If Wei Wuxian had his way, they’d be here arguing back and forth for hours. Not exactly the most productive use of Jiang Cheng’s time.</p><p>But the other man just beams brightly back at him. “Screw you,” he says, his tone lacking any real heat. At Jiang Cheng’s subsequent scowl, he lets out a snicker. “Oh, wait. I forgot – that’s someone else’s job.”</p><p>A waggle of eyebrows follows, along with a leer that’s probably meant to be filthy but just makes him look foolish. Despite that, Jiang Cheng feels all the blood in his body get redirected to his face.</p><p>“Shut up,” he snaps, but it’s ineffectual, because Wei Wuxian’s shit-eating grin stretches even wider.</p><p>“So, you and Zewu-Jun, huh?” He picks up a clump of rice and pops it in his mouth. “I have to say, I did not see that coming.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s hand reaches across the table, chopsticks pointed towards Jiang Cheng’s bowl, and he slaps the offending limb away before it can get too close. “It’s nothing like that,” he says defensively, hoping to the gods that his face isn’t too red right now.</p><p>“Really? I saw you the other day, you know.” The other man gives up on stealing Jiang Cheng’s food, going for his own this time instead. “Wearing his clothes.”</p><p>“It wasn’t anything like that,” he repeats, beginning to feel like a parrot. “I visited him and it was raining, so he insisted I change clothes. That was all.”</p><p>Yeah, okay, now that he says it out loud, that sounds rather… suspicious, to put it mildly. Judging by the rather impressive smirk Jiang Cheng’s older brother is displaying, Wei Wuxian thinks so too.</p><p>Damn it to hell. Why did he have to bring this up? And why now, of all times? Jiang Cheng isn’t emotionally prepared for this.</p><p>“Sure,” the other man says, not sounding even remotely convinced. Then his eyes light up like he’s just realised something, and Jiang Cheng’s stomach sinks. <em>Oh, no</em>. “Hold on – you’re still visiting him? After–” he makes a vague circling motion with his hand – “everything, I thought you weren’t going to keep doing that.”</p><p>The leader of the Yunmeng Jiang sect resists the urge to cover his ears like a child and sing over his brother’s obnoxious, teasing voice. How is he supposed to explain this – whatever this is that’s going on with him and Lan Xichen? Political alliance? Friendship? He doesn’t even know himself.</p><p><em>There’s nothing to explain,</em> he thinks resolutely. The whispers in his ears can just fuck right off, thank you very much.</p><p>“Well, I am,” he says out loud, tamping down his chaotic thoughts. “And anyway, I thought you’d assumed we were fucking,” he scoffs. “Why are you so surprised that I’m seeing him–”</p><p>He stops dead when he registers the words that have just left his mouth. Shit, that came out wrong. A triumphant expression steals across Wei Wuxian’s face, so insufferably smug that Jiang Cheng would want to punch it off him if he wasn’t so completely paralysed with horror.</p><p>He backtracks hurriedly. “That’s not what I meant,” he blusters, attempting to cover his panic with an admittedly sub-par glower. But it’s too late. He’s rammed his foot so far down his throat that he’s never going to be able to pull it out again without rearranging his own intestines.</p><p>In this moment, Jiang Cheng’s older brother looks just as demonic as he did during his stint as the Yiling Patriarch. Obviously there are gods in this world, and they have forsaken Jiang Cheng’s sorry ass in favour of laughing at his misery because of all the increasingly embarrassing, awful things that have happened to him since he left Lotus Pier, this is by far the worst.</p><p>Wei Wuxian is fucking <em>cackling </em>at him, head thrown back and loud, high-pitched noises escaping his open mouth. Jiang Cheng curses at him, but he just laughs harder, gasping for breath in between howls.</p><p>Gods damn it. He almost wishes they were fighting again. Almost.</p><p>Finally, the hysterics slowly die down and the older man sobers up a little. Not enough, though – the glint in his eyes is still all too amused for Jiang Cheng’s peace of mind.</p><p>“Your face,” Wei Wuxian gets out, still huffing with mirth. Jiang Cheng’s stomach sinks further into his bowels. He lifts a hand and claps it to his aforementioned face, fingers spread on his cheek and palm over his eyes.</p><p>It’s enough to set Wei Wuxian off again.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>“What I don’t get is why you’re being so uptight about this.”</p><p>It’s after lunch now, and Wei Wuxian is lounging on a bench next to the wall, all four limbs sprawled out like a cat napping in the afternoon sun. It’s a two-person couch – ostensibly intended to also fit Lan Wangji’s ass and the massive stick he stashes up it – but the one-time demonic cultivator has commandeered the entire thing, spreading himself out to fill every available space.</p><p>It took him the rest of their meal to finally calm down, though a stray giggle did escape him now and again, and now that the dishes have been left in the kitchen (Jiang Cheng isn’t touching those – someone else can clean them up), he’s happy and relaxed, lying across his husband’s furniture like it’s a throne.</p><p>And needling Jiang Cheng, of course. Can’t forget about that. No, Wei Wuxian’s life is not complete until he’s made his younger brother’s as difficult as possible.</p><p>Honestly, Jiang Cheng should have escaped when he had the chance. Except for the fact that he <em>had</em> no chance, because Wei Wuxian has a grip like a vice, and the bastard’s been following him around for days and knows his fucking schedule. Now he’s pestering Jiang Cheng for details about his <strike>apparent</strike> <em>nonexistent</em> relationship with his gods-damn brother-in-law.</p><p>Jiang Cheng wants to kill something. Preferably Wei Wuxian.</p><p>“Look, could you fucking drop it already? There’s nothing to tell.”</p><p>And there isn’t. With Wei Wuxian’s incessant pestering, Jiang Cheng’s been forced to spill the whole story, leaving out the bits about Lan Xichen’s application to the matchmaker – that’s the other sect leader’s secret to tell. Nothing even happened anyway; Wei Wuxian got himself all worked up over nothing.</p><p>At least, that’s what Jiang Cheng thinks. His older brother seems to have quite a different opinion. He can’t imagine why.</p><p>“I mean,” Wei Wuxian continues, running his mouth yet again, obviously unable to accede to what was a stupidly simple request to <em>just drop it</em>, “you said you’re friends with the guy, right?”</p><p>He looks at Jiang Cheng expectantly, and the unfortunate man in question has no choice but to nod reluctantly, glaring at him all the while.</p><p>“Then why do you keep telling me to stop talking every time I bring him up?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Jiang Cheng answers automatically.</p><p>Wei Wuxian folds his arms across his chest. “See? You just did it again. There’s something you’re not telling me.”</p><p>Clearly, not even Jiang Cheng’s best death glare can get Wei Wuxian to keep his mouth closed once he gets going on something. He uncrosses his arms, lifting a hand to his face to stroke an imaginary beard like he’s pretending to be some sort of Confucian scholar. Or Lan Qiren.</p><p>Then his hand stills mid-stroke. His eyes widen to comically large proportions.</p><p>“Oh,” he says. “<em>Oh</em>.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng forgets to maintain his glare, brows furrowing in puzzlement instead. “What?”</p><p>“Oh,” Wei Wuxian says again, only pulling himself out of whatever ‘enlightened’ stupor he’s fallen into when Jiang Cheng snaps at him to explain himself for the second time.</p><p>“My gods, Jiang Cheng, do you actually like Zewu-Jun?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng gives him an unimpressed look. “Of course I like him, dumbass. We’re friends. He’s decent company, and he doesn’t ask dumb questions. Unlike some other people I know.”</p><p>An outraged gasp comes from the couch where Wei Wuxian is now sitting up, back straight and at full attention. “First of all, that was uncalled for,” he says, his hand pressed to his chest like he’s about to swoon like a maiden in an opera. Then he looks back at Jiang Cheng, rakes him over with his eyes as though he’s looking for something, and throws up his hands when he doesn’t find it.</p><p>“Second of all,” he continues, “you’re hopeless. Absolutely hopeless. The question wasn’t ‘do you like him as a friend?’, genius. I was asking you if you <em>like</em> him.”</p><p>He gives Jiang Cheng a significant look, and it takes a solid second for the understanding to hit him. When it does, he recoils.</p><p>“Fuck, no,” he spits out less than a moment later. In his defense, Jiang Cheng can’t help the profanity – it’s a knee-jerk reaction to a ridiculous question, one that feels like a sharp branch digging into his skin. He’s not even attracted to men. Why would Wei Wuxian think that?</p><p>A tiny (but disproportionately loud) voice in his head notes that it’s not like he’s ever <em>looked</em> at anyone. Hell, he’s only spared more than a glance for maybe three or four women over the years, and one of them was his sister.</p><p><em>You could be</em>, it whispers, soft and silvery. <em>Anyway, you can’t argue that Lan Xichen is easy on the eyes.</em></p><p><em>That’s not the point</em>, he retorts. Then he realises he’s arguing with himself like a lunatic. Great. Just great.</p><p>“What part of ‘we’re friends’ do you not understand?”, Jiang Cheng asks aloud, his tone as cutting as he can make it. This is utter bullshit. Irrationally, he feels as though he’s being backed into a corner, Wei Wuxian’s endless questions coming like a barrage or an interrogation, closing in on him until his skin is too tight for his bones and he wants to crawl out of his body to find a new one. Something that can move, away from the scrutiny.</p><p>Jiang Cheng fucking hates interrogations.</p><p>“Yeah, but–”</p><p>“But nothing,” he interrupts, staring down Wei Wuxian in the way he’s been told makes him look almost exactly like his mother at the height of her ‘pissed off drill sergeant’ moods. It’s a look that Wei Wuxian – both of them, in fact – have been conditioned to respond to; to see it, shut up and acquiesce to the demands being made of him. The older man quails in the face of the full force of it.</p><p>“Alright, alright, I’ll drop it.” He raises his hands, palms facing forward, in a gesture of surrender. His robes rustle as he shifts his position on the couch, leaning back to get more comfortable.</p><p>It’s an open invitation to change the subject, and Jiang Cheng is almost desperate to take it. But not quite.</p><p>Instead he stands, smoothing out the near-invisible creases in his violet robes. Wei Wuxian starts, makes a move to get to his feet, but Jiang Cheng waves a hand at him to tell him to sit back down.</p><p>“There’s no need for that. I just have…something I must do.”</p><p>His older brother’s mouth opens as if to say something. Probably to protest how Jiang Cheng has no engagements planned for this afternoon, or even the rest of the day. Or anything else he needs to prepare for.</p><p>But then he speaks, and the words that come out of his mouth are completely unexpected. “Are– are we okay?”</p><p>His voice is small. Soft and quavering, like a child needing reassurance, even though Wei Wuxian has always been the elder of the two of them. The more fearless. Jiang Cheng allows himself a tiny smile.</p><p>“Yes,” he says. “Yes, we are.”</p><p>He hears Wei Wuxian’s relieved sigh echo through the room as he takes his leave of Hanguang-Jun’s <em>jingshi</em>.</p><p>When the door closes behind him and he walks out into the winding pathways of Cloud Recesses, Jiang Cheng feels lighter than he has in a long while. <em>We’re okay</em>, he thinks, and for the first time in over a year, it doesn’t feel like something he has to convince himself of. Just something that is.</p><p>He could have stayed. Could have taken Wei Wuxian up on his offer of continued conversation. He might have, even. But this is a good place to end things off, at least today. It is enough for now.</p><p>And anyway, Jiang Cheng has an appointment to keep.</p>

          <p>Hey everybody! I'm back! So, so sorry for the late update - I think this is the longest I've taken to finish a chapter since I started writing this fic. But anyway, Happy Lunar New Year!!!!!! <br/>恭喜发财, 新年快乐, 万事如意, 身体健康, 年年有余!!!! &lt;3<br/>I hope everyone received lots of hongbao, ate a whole ton of junk food, and saw all your favourite relatives (if you celebrate LNY, that is). In Singapore, it's a pretty big deal - we get a long weekend and everything. All of my relatives live overseas, though, so we did minimal visiting except for going to a few friends' houses.<br/>On another note, actual JC orientation has started up. We've got another two days of it to go, and I'm pretty excited, because this is the first time I've been in a co-ed school in ten years, so hanging around guys is going to be interesting. My group is pretty cool, though, so I hope I'll have a good time. For those of you starting JC this year, good luck and have fun! :)))))<br/>By the way, does anyone watch Castlevania? I just got started on it a couple days ago, and binged both seasons in less than a day. It's amazing - I think I've found my new obsession. Please come scream at me on Tumblr about it if you want.<br/>Today's song recommendation is 'Sorry About Your Parents' by Icon For Hire. It's kind of dark with a nasty undertone that I think fits JC's character pretty well. I'd also like to rec @jasminemelt's awesome fic 'A Gift Upon This Exhausting Path Of Life'. It's a balladeer XiCheng AU, colourful and brilliantly done.<br/>Have a great day, and see you next time!</p>

    <p>The door opens barely five seconds after Jiang Cheng first knocks on it, revealing Lan Xichen’s high cheekbones and amber eyes, widened like a startled cat. The corner of his mouth is red and there’s a faint imprint of a line in his lower lip, as though he’s been biting it.</p><p>“Oh,” he says, blinking owlishly when his gaze settles on Jiang Cheng. The lines of his body soften. “You’re here.”</p><p>The older sect leader invites Jiang Cheng inside, pours twin mugs of tea as has practically become their custom over the past few days, all while Jiang Cheng fills him in on the details of this morning’s meeting. It’s quick and efficient – a proper report – but somehow, it manages to seem almost perfunctory. Technically perfect, down to every last detail, but something about it feels rushed, even to Jiang Cheng, who’s doing the talking. As though they’re trying to get it out of the way for something else.</p><p>As though the reports are no longer the main goal of Jiang Cheng’s visits.</p><p>Lan Xichen can feel it too – Jiang Cheng knows he can. But neither of them brings it up. The balance between them is still too new, too fragile, and neither man wants to upset it.</p><p>When Jiang Cheng comes to the end of his description of the day’s events, he stops talking to sip at his tea. It’s still hot, but not too much so, and the warmth soothes his throat as it goes down.</p><p>The other man has already finished his, and those long, graceful fingers turn the mug over in his hands as he considers Jiang Cheng’s words. The gathering this morning was decidedly uneventful, negotiations running slowly but smoothly as the convocation of sect leaders hashed out benefits and compromises. Jiang Cheng can’t imagine what he would want to say about it.</p><p>But the next words out of Lan Xichen’s mouth aren’t about the meeting.</p><p>“You came late today,” he notes, brows slightly pinched together in a way that creates the smallest crease between them. “Did something happen?”</p><p>There is concern in his voice. Of <em>course</em> there is, and when Jiang Cheng glances at the clock on the side table, he can see that Lan Xichen is right. He is late; he usually comes straight here after the meetings, and now the hour hand is already creeping towards the horizontal position.</p><p>A sudden stab of guilt assails Jiang Cheng. He doesn’t know why – he’s showed up, hasn’t he? So what if he’s a little late? It’s not like they’ve set a time for these things. But the heavy feeling doesn’t go away, and he busies himself with the mug in his hands, staring at the brown surface of the tea as though it holds the answers to the universe.</p><p>“No, not at all. I was simply… detained for a while.”</p><p>“Oh,” Lan Xichen says again. The word holds a strange note, and Jiang Cheng can’t help but look up at him. It’s a mistake, because their eyes lock, blue with dark gold, and a pulse of something sharp and hot runs all the way through him.</p><p>“I thought you weren’t coming,” is the next thing he hears, the admission so soft it’s nearly a whisper. And Jiang Cheng must be hallucinating, must be imagining the sadness in it, because there’s no fucking <em>way</em> anyone should sound so dejected at the thought of not seeing him.</p><p>He can’t look away.</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s insufferably smug voice floats by his ear, and Jiang Cheng can almost see the expression that goes along with it, also insufferably smug. <em>So, you and Zewu-Jun, huh?</em></p><p>The words are like a bucket of cold water straight to the face, with the bucket tossed over afterwards for good measure. Jiang Cheng snaps out of whatever trance he’s been in almost immediately, his hand jerking so hard it’s a good thing his tea is nearly finished, or it would end up all over the front of his robes.</p><p>The other man gives him a worried look, brows still furrowed but the eyes beneath them soft, and Jiang Cheng stutters out empty reassurances that he’s fine and nothing’s wrong, all the while cursing himself and his stupid, <em>stupid</em> dumbass older brother for planting these thoughts in his head. Because all of a sudden, it’s like a lever has been pulled, and now Jiang Cheng is so very aware of the man seated opposite him. Every move that he makes, every breath he takes, a constant hum buzzing over every one of Jiang Cheng’s nerves.</p><p>Fuck. This is all Wei Wuxian’s fault, Jiang Cheng thinks viciously. It’s completely normal, is what it is – an ordinary response to the insinuation that one is <em>maybe in love</em> with one’s best – and possibly only – friend. He’s simply… alert, is all. Paying more attention. Of course.</p><p>He raises the mug to his lips and downs the last of his tea, then sets it down on the floor where he’s less likely to have another fit and drop the damn thing. It clears his mind a little, though the hum is still there, beneath the surface, difficult to ignore now that he’s noticed its presence. He’ll manage.</p><p>“I was talking to Wei Wuxian,” says Jiang Cheng finally, in an effort to move past his idiotic display. It works, and Lan Xichen is successfully distracted with asking about what happened. How it went. Their status now.</p><p>And underpinning it all, the unspoken question: <em>are you all right?</em></p><p>It’s strange, because coming from anyone else, that would have Jiang Cheng spitting flames, up in arms and verbally eviscerating anyone who dared to think that he couldn’t handle his life perfectly fine on his own, reducing them to a shaking, quivering mess cowering away out of fear for their life. But from Lan Xichen, it doesn’t sound like a challenge or an accusation, or another jab at his competence. It’s just a question, but it’s soft and warm and soothes all the sharp edges that Jiang Cheng usually uses to rip everything around him apart.</p><p>So instead of snapping irritably back at the other man’s concern, Jiang Cheng answers his questions. He tells him everything – minus the part where they’d talked about him (obviously, Jiang Cheng isn’t that stupid), and allows himself to feel like a cat basking in the sun of Lan Xichen’s smile when he realises they’ve reconciled.</p><p>“I’m happy for you,” Lan Xichen says when he’s done. Jiang Cheng can tell he means it, too, because he’s doing the head-tilt thing again and his eyes are all crinkled up at the corners – it’s so fucking unfair that they don’t just disappear into a line when he grins like everyone else. “Anyone can see that the two of you love each other very much.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, we may not be related by blood, but he’s still my brother. And he’s all I’ve got, other than Jin Ling, that is.”</p><p>The other man hums, sensing the subject change for what it is. “Speaking of Young Master Jin, how is he? Wangji says he’s become quite close with Sizhui lately.”</p><p>The memory of last night – his nephew leaning against a tree, bare to the waist with the other boy’s hands on him – surfaces in his mind. <em>No, no</em>, Jiang Cheng thinks fractically and forces it back down.</p><p>“That’s the understatement of the year,” he mutters, before he can think about what he’s just said. The moment it catches up to him, he flushes bright red. <em>Oh, fuck.</em> “Sorry. That just slipped out.”</p><p>But Lan Xichen is leaning towards him, hands splayed out over his knees to support his weight. There is a glimmer of interest in those dark gold eyes that makes the prim, proper First Jade of the Gusu Lan sect look almost mischievous.</p><p>“No, please do go on.”</p><p>“You’re a fucking gossip, aren’t you? I can’t believe this.”</p><p>“There’s very little else to do in here,” the other man points out reasonably. “Come on, Jiang Wanyin. Indulge my curiosity.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng isn’t sure whether to be impressed or mildly horrified. He settles on a mixture of both. Gods, it really is always the quiet ones, isn’t it? But now that he’s mentioned it, he can’t exactly back out. He’s not a coward. Much.</p><p>Two minutes later, he’s relaying the story of last night’s horror show to an increasingly amused Lan Xichen, who has long since given up trying to maintain a neutral expression and has now graduated to hiding a shit-eating grin behind one long-fingered hand.</p><p>“…So there he is, in the fucking forest in the middle of the night, with his robes half off and fucking <em>marks sucked into the side of his neck</em>, and the little shit tells me they were wrestling. <em>Wrestling.</em>” Jiang Cheng pauses in his tirade to take a breath, and sees Lan Xichen is no longer covering his smile.</p><p>A sharp noise escapes him, and Jiang Cheng recognizes what it is even before the older man can think to bite it back. A snicker. Lan Xichen is snickering at him. He should be indignant at the very thought, but all he feels is a pleased little warmth fluttering in his chest.</p><p>“At the very least, I thought he’d be able to come up with something better.”</p><p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the precise moment Sect Leader Lan absolutely fucking loses it and dissolves into helpless laughter, the half-restrained chuckles escalating into full-blown howls and guffaws. Jiang Cheng has always hated it when people laugh at him, but despite it all, he can’t help the way the corners of his mouth twitch upwards.</p><p>It’s a beautiful sound. He wants to make Lan Xichen laugh like that again, just to hear it. He doesn’t say that, of course.</p><p>“I’m glad my suffering amuses you,” is what comes out instead, dry and sardonic. Perhaps too much so, and Jiang Cheng freezes for a second before the other man’s smile stretches wider as he struggles to get his breathing under control.</p><p>When he finally does, his eyes are dancing with poorly disguised mirth. “It’s not <em>your </em>suffering that holds my attention so, Wanyin. But Young Master Jin –” he sighs – “that poor boy.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng gapes. Gods, Zewu-Jun’s sense of humour is even worse than his own. No wonder he acts so prim and proper all the time; Old Man Lan would probably have an aneurysm otherwise. “You can’t be serious,” he scoffs. “I’m never going to be able to unsee that.”</p><p>“But imagine how much worse it was for him. I know if Shu-Fu had ever walked in on <em>me</em> like that, I would have expired on the spot. As it is, I can only imagine the trauma.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng opens his mouth to argue that it’d been Jin Ling’s fault <em>anyway</em>, when the meaning of the other man’s words catches up to him. His brain stalls.</p><p>“You– you’ve–?” The words refuse to come, no matter how hard he tries to finish the sentence. Finally, he lets it trail off into the air rather than continue to embarrass himself further.</p><p>Luckily, Lan Xichen seems to know what he means. Jiang Cheng isn’t sure he could vocalize it even if he tried.</p><p>The older sect leader lets out a low chuckle. “I’m thirty-seven, Wanyin. And contrary to popular belief, cultivators from my sect aren’t actually emotionless automatons. We have… desires, like anyone else.”</p><p>A lump forms in Jiang Cheng’s throat, strangely heavy. His mouth suddenly feels very dry and he swallows a couple times to rid himself of the feeling. It doesn’t quite work.</p><p><em>Well, that’s just fantastic then,</em> his brain snips at him. <em>Great fucking job. You’re more chaste than cultivators from fucking Gusu. And their founder was a damn monk.</em></p><p>He feels a blush warm his cheeks as Lan Xichen looks him up and down, blinking slowly, long lashes sliding lazy over cat-gold eyes. The feelings in his stomach are a mix he can’t identify, a cocktail that both confuses and frightens him. Or it would, if Jiang Cheng were a man to be frightened of his own emotions.</p><p>Which he is decidedly not.</p><p>A look of realisation crosses the older man’s face. “You haven’t, have you? Been with anyone?”</p><p>This time, Jiang Cheng looks away, mortified. It’s one thing to bring up such thoughts in the privacy of his own head. It’s another one entirely to hear someone else voice them. Particularly someone like Lan Xichen, who nods as though Jiang Cheng’s silence is answer enough.</p><p>It probably is. Denial is a skill Jiang Cheng is well versed in, but only when it comes to himself; he’s never quite been able to fool other people. It’s yet another one of his shortcomings. There are oh-so-many of those.</p><p>His only consolation is that, across from him, Lan Xichen is going equally red. His head dips a little, gaze cast towards the floor and he says, “I apologise for overstepping. It’s none of my business.”</p><p>“Damn right it’s not,” Jiang Cheng barks out gruffly, too embarrassed to care that he’s being rude. Well, there go the last shreds of his tattered dignity. He represses a sigh. It put up a good fight, but he’d known it was doomed years ago. It was a lost cause, really, ever since a three-year-old Jin Ling had thrown up on him during one of their annual inter-sect gatherings.</p><p>Lan Xichen had been the only one not snickering behind his hand. Even took the toddler back to his nurse so Jiang Cheng could go clean himself up. Jiang Cheng wonders why he remembers that.</p><p>Honestly, it’s no wonder he hasn’t “been with” anyone yet. He’s a total fucking disaster.</p><p>A shaky exhale from the man in front of him jolts Jiang Cheng out of his thoughts. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Lan Xichen is holding back laughter, and Jiang Cheng immediately goes on the defensive.</p><p>“The hell you laughing at?”</p><p>“Nothing,” the older man says, shaking his head, the corners of his mouth upticked despite himself. “It’s just… it could be worse, you know.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng raises an eyebrow, challenging. “How?”</p><p>“At least you’re not Jin Guangshan.”</p>

          <p>Hey there, everyone! I'm back! Miss me? Anyway, school has started up again since we finished orientation (whoa, the dances were crazy), and it's... way harder than I expected it to be. And it's not like I thought it was going to be easy, but there you go. Lectures are tough, man.</p><p>So, here's another chapter, after over a week of waiting (sorry about that).  I hope everyone's doing okay and enjoying the year so far. I'm not real proud of today's chapter because it looks a bit crack-y and OOC to me, but I had fun writing it, so it's going up anyway. It just seems to me like LXC is way less pure than his surface portrayal in canon, because he's so quiet and it's always the quiet - the 乖 - ones you have to watch out for. I'm not even kidding. Those people have the filthiest minds. I mean, look at NHS and his you-know-what collection. JC is only now discovering this, and his mind is being blown (poor boy), but we all have to find it out sometime. I think that for LXC, his personality isn't explored all that much in the novel and that gives us as fandom content creators a lot of wiggle room for headcanons - which is great, because I figure that LXC has a lot of facets to his personality that he doesn't necessarily show to the outside world. This is the guy who managed to be friends with NMJ and JGY (as well as NHS) at the same time while maintaining relative sanity, so it's probably safe to say that he has hidden depths.</p><p>Today's song rec is "Jet Lag" by Simple Plan, which I am currently listening to on repeat because I love it so much. It's also a pretty good song (I think) for JC and LXC's relationship because their homes are so far apart and so that's a great recipe for some quality pining. No? Anyone? Also, I just read the first chapter of this XiCheng modern-reincarnation-AU that was put up on AO3 today, and it has so much potential. I'm very excited for where the author is going to take this. For those of you who want to check it out, it's "Atlas: Two" by @ahegaos :)</p><p>Oh, and before I go, here are some more fic ideas for anyone struggling with generating plots. I'm not sure if anyone actually wants to read these, but here we go:</p><p>1. Castlevania AU - Okay, hear me out. It sounds weird, but I've been thinking about this ever since I saw Trevor Belmont use his whip on the Netflix show. JC as Trevor Belmont, a young monster hunter who is the sole remaining heir to his house after his entire family (including his elder sister and brother) was burned alive by the Church when he was very young. LXC as Alucard/Adrian Tepes, a dhampir on a quest to stop his vampire father (QHJ) from eradicating the whole of the human race after his mother and younger brother were also murdered by the Church. NHS as Sypha Belnades, a Speaker-Magician eager to experience the world beyond the arm of his protective clan leader older brother. Oh, and the Wen clan as members of the Church - WRH as the archbishop, while WC is the bishop of Gresit and WQ and WN are friendly priests and nuns they meet along the way.</p><p>2. Supernatural AU, in which WWX is Dean, the Michael sword, and JC is Sam, the vessel of Lucifer. They hunt monsters together while trying to avert the apocalypse with the help of LWJ (as Castiel), their angel ally who fell in love with WWX. Everything's going all right - or as all right as it can be during the End of Days - but JC is struggling with himself and the role he's supposed to play. Enter the forces of Heaven, who decide that LWJ can be brought back to their side with a little coercion, and send LXC, the angel closest to him to Earth to attempt to sway him. This goes about as well as you'd expect.</p><p>3. This is the last one for today, but also the one I'm most unsure about. See, I have a lot of story ideas, but very little courage to put them out as original works, and so I'm thinking of adapting some of them into fanfics so I can take a look at the reception and what I need to fix. My sister says it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if anyone's going to want to read them. Please tell me what you think, and if I should give it a shot.</p><p>By for now, and thank you so much for reading :)</p>

    <p>When Jiang Wanyin chokes on nothing but air, Lan Huan almost brings himself to regret his comment. ‘Almost’ being the operative word.</p><p>Truth be told, it’s rather refreshing, to be so open around another person. Lan Huan’s personality has always lain more to the mischievous side, to sarcastic comments and quick retorts, and a penchant for dirty humour he developed during his months with Meng Yao. A personality much like Lan Jingyi’s, now that he thinks about it, which is perfectly fine for a young disciple only distantly related to the family that heads their clan.</p><p>For Lan Huan, the sect leader himself, it is… less so.</p><p>And thus, from a young age, he had to learn – painstakingly – how to comply with each and every one of their sect’s near-five thousand clan rules, how to walk with grace and talk with reserve, contenting himself with only the occasional subtle joke to indulge his desire for humour. It had to be subtle. Always.</p><p>Years ago, Lan Huan had found it stifling. Suffocating, even, to have to bite back almost everything he had to say, to rein in his emotions and present a placid smile to the world instead, but he’d had to, for the sake of his family and his sect. And eventually, he grew used to it. It felt less like drowning and a little more like breathing underwater, sucking liquid into his lungs and drawing out what oxygen he could, and he could almost pretend that that was the way he was meant to be, and always had been.</p><p>But now, it’s like he’s finally broken the surface, been allowed to take in air again, and he’s forgotten how good it feels, how light and <em>easy</em> it is to not have to fight to fill his chest. To breathe.</p><p>He doesn’t know <em>why</em> he feels so comfortable like this, talking to Jiang Wanyin of all people, showing him a side of Lan Huan that no one’s seen in years. A side of himself that by now, even Lan Huan can barely remember he has. Perhaps it’s the other man’s background: the youthful shenanigans Jiang Wanyin owned up to during their conversation only a few days ago, his childhood spent by the side of Wei Wuxian, the reigning holder of the cultivation world’s title of ‘most shameless’. Perhaps it is the man himself – this hurricane of a person, hot-tempered and defensive with a tongue as sharps as the steel blade of a sword, who carries around rice crackers to feed to ducks and talks for hours about falling in love. Who curses to make Lan Huan feel better and walks through downpours to keep his promises. Who somehow without even trying, has managed to worm his way into Lan Huan’s friendship after Lan Huan swore never to trust another person again.</p><p>It’s a kind of delicious irony that locked away from the outside world, this is the most open he’s ever felt.</p><p>That, however, does not change the fact that man in front of him is turning a truly concerning shade of red and Lan Huan fears that if he does not do something soon, he might lose his hard-won new friend. He decides to take pity on him, choosing to remain silent to allow Jiang Wanyin to catch his breath.</p><p>A short while later, the younger man does return to normal, although a light flush still dusts his cheeks. It’s not surprising that he’s shocked, Lan Huan thinks wryly. He doesn’t usually speak this freely (brazenly) around – well, around anyone, really. The change in demeanour is probably incredibly jarring for the poor man.</p><p>The aforementioned man raises his hands, palms facing upwards, in surrender. Something jolts in Lan Huan’s stomach; Jiang Wanyin has never submitted to anyone, at least not of his own free will. Or not that Lan Huan knows of.</p><p>“Why is everyone around me like this?”, he grumbles. “Did Wei Wuxian poison the water supply?”</p><p>Despite his words, the other man is not truly angry, and Lan Huan chuckles again. “Perhaps you simply surround yourself with a certain kind of person.”</p><p>“And why the hell would I do that?”</p><p>“Perhaps you secretly enjoy suffering,” Lan Huan says, relishing the way Jiang Wanyin lets out a little huff through his nose and crosses his arms over his chest again. It’s extraordinarily endearing, considering that the man doing it is a full three decades of age and then some, and a respected cultivator and sect leader to boot.</p><p>And an <em>innocent</em>.</p><p>Now it’s Lan Huan’s turn to colour. Despite the slight ribbing, he really wasn’t expecting that admission, that answer to the question he’d asked. Least of all from Jiang Wanyin. The other sect leader had seemed so jaded, so world-weary, so mature. A holdover from having to grow up too much, too fast, Lan Huan supposes. He’d just assumed that would have extended to other areas as well.</p><p>Yet it makes a certain kind of sense, too. Orphaned and pressed into fighting a war at seventeen, then becoming a single parent scarcely two years later, it was no wonder Jiang Wanyin had never found the time for something as mundane as a partner. In fact, it would have truly been a surprise if he had.</p><p>A pang of sympathy stirs in Lan Huan’s chest, accompanied by something else he can’t identify. How much has Jiang Wanyin missed out on because of the hand life has dealt him, because of all the things he’s had to do and sacrifice? How much of the world has passed him by because there is always something bigger, something more important that needs his attention instead? But it’s a fruitless question, because Lan Huan already knows the answer: too much.</p><p>It’s the story of all their lives, really – the men and women of their generation. Children of war, lives torn apart by fire and death and knowing little else, just trying to figure out how to navigate the peace they gave their youths to restore. It is every one of them, but Lan Huan thinks the burden weighs heaviest on the man in front of him, because he had to bear it alone.</p><p>Lan Huan feels his melancholic thoughts spiraling, and reels them back in with an effort. He leans forward, pushes himself to his feet; at Jiang Wanyin’s questioning look, he explains that he’s going to pour them some more tea. Yes, tea. One of the (few) unspoken rules in Gusu is that nearly every problem can be solved with a pot of tea. Maybe two, if the situation is dire enough to require it.</p><p>He enters the kitchen and then minutes later, emerges with ceramic teapot in hand. His guest has changed positions since Lan Huan left. Jiang Wanyin is now perched behind the only corner of Lan Huan’s tiny desk that isn’t piled high with reports, scribbling on his own – notably smaller – stack of paper with a brush he’s produced seemingly out of thin air.</p><p>His legs are folded beneath him in a pose much less formal than the kneeling position that’s customary for meetings between sect leaders, more suited for comfort than decorum. The violet sleeves of his outer robes are rolled up to the elbow, exposing strong, corded forearms lithe with sinew rather than bulging muscle. His brow is furrowed in concentration, those blue-grey eyes focused on the words on the paper in front of him.</p><p>It’s surprisingly domestic. The other sect leader looks so at home here, as though this cottage is his too and he’s just come back from–</p><p>Lan Huan drops the teapot.</p><p>It hits the ground and shatters, breaking into pieces with a crash and a surprisingly high-sounding clatter. Suddenly, there are pottery shards of varying sizes all over the floor, chips scattering like dust between others almost as large as Lan Huan’s fist, jagged at the edges and wickedly sharp. Lan Huan can make out half the teapot’s handle there, over near the chair leg; to the left, the intact spout.</p><p>To make matters worse, the pot had been nearly full when he dropped it. Still-steaming tea seeps out from between the shards, trickling into the gaps in the floorboards.</p><p>“Fuck,” says Lan Huan, looking down at the mess. Then he claps a hand over his mouth. <em>Oh, no</em>.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin, who had been in the process of jotting down a line of characters, jerks up at the noise. His eyes go wide when he takes in the teapot, now lying in myriad pieces all over the floor.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Lan Huan says apologetically. “I hadn’t meant to say that; it just slipped out.”</p><p>The other man makes a disbelieving noise and cocks an eyebrow. And just like that, all Lan Huan’s hopes that his brief, surprise-induced exclamation had gone unheard sink right through the floorboards along with his tea.</p><p>“So you can make jokes about orgies, but you can’t say ‘fuck’?” Jiang Wanyin turns his gaze to Lan Huan, who’s still standing there frozen, covering his mouth. “What kind of logic is that?”</p><p>The world moves in cycles, Lan Huan is discovering, because it’s now his turn to blush like a village maiden receiving her first compliment. He shouldn’t have laughed at the younger man earlier. He really shouldn’t have.</p><p>It’s nigh-impossible to talk around the heat in his cheeks; made doubly so by the fact that Jiang Wanyin has put down his brush and is now walking towards him, stepping carefully over the wet spots and pottery fragments, and it’s difficult for Lan Huan to look anywhere else. His tongue feels too large for his mouth when he says, “vulgarities are prohibited in the Cloud Recesses.”</p><p>“And the things you said earlier <em>weren’t </em>vulgarities?”</p><p>“Not explicitly, no.”</p><p>“Oh, loopholes. That’s fucking fantas– oh, wait.” The shorter man pauses for a moment as though he’s just realised something. One corner of his mouth quirks upward into a lopsided grin. “What’s the punishment for breaking the rule?”</p><p><em>Why does that matter? </em>“Copying out the first half of book one of the Gusu Lan sect rules while doing a handstand,” he recites instead of voicing his question. “Three times, with periodic checks for neatness of handwriting and legibility. Shu-Fu dislikes coarse language.”</p><p>“And have you ever had to do it?”</p><p>“Not that I can remember. Why?”</p><p>“I think,” Jiang Wanyin says, still grinning, “that I’ve been a bad influence on you.”</p><p>Briefly, Lan Huan goes quiet in consideration of what he’s just heard. The guilt of breaking a sect rule twists in his stomach and then dissolves, melting into a puddle and draining away. It leaves him feeling strangely light.</p><p>“Yes,” he agrees. “Shu-Fu will probably hate you for it.”</p><p>“For what – tainting his precious nephew? You seem to have been doing that just fine on your own. In fact, I’m not completely sure you’re not the one tainting me.”</p><p>“Oh, fuck you,” replies Lan Huan. It’s missing something, so he adds, “asshole.”</p><p>The answering bark of laughter that Jiang Wanyin lets out is sharp and bright, like a firework on the first night of the New Year. It assuages any doubts Lan Huan has about his use of those words, forbidden by his sect but now that he’s said them, seeming so mundane and ordinary.</p><p>“See? All you’re doing is proving me right.”</p><p>Lan Huan bends down to pick up a particularly large piece of the broken teapot. The edges are razor-sharp, liable to cut into skin at the slightest pressure, but Lan Huan uses his fingers to pinch the centre of it.</p><p>“I don’t make the rules,” he says softly. The contrast in volume between their conversation before and his voice now makes the room feel smaller somehow. The air within its four walls feels charged. With what, Lan Huan can’t tell.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin reaches forward and plucks the shard from his hand. Carefully, he lays it at the edge of the table. And then, equally quietly, he responds with, “no, you don’t.”</p><p>“But you can.”</p>

          <p>Hey everybody! I'm back with a relatively quick update this time. It's a little late, but this chapter is for JGY and JZX's joint birthday, which was yesterday :) Happy birthday Lanling Bros!!!</p><p>This chapter is also for my little sister, who celebrated the anniversary of her birth yesterday as well, and who is my most favourite person in the whole world. She's not in this fandom, but she's incredibly supportive of this fic and is willing to let me rant at her about MDZS and XiCheng on a regular basis. If you ever read this, I love you li'l sis!</p><p>Back to business: this chapter was also a teeny bit OOC - or at least, it felt that way to me - but it was so much fun to right so that's secondary, right? This is just 2,000 words of LXC learning to cut loose a little, and discovering that being himself isn't going to send JC running for the hills. Also, XiCheng roasting each other just made me happy to write, so that's what came out.</p><p>Today's song is 'Unwell' by Matchbox Twenty, for reasons that should become a little more obvious if you give the song a listen. (Okay, maybe not so much; I just love angsting about my favourite characters while listening to music with equally angsty lyrics.) I also recommend '地与天', a song by the fabulously talented artist 胡歌 (Hu Ge), who is also an actor and played the lead role in one of my favourite Chinese dramas of all time - 琅琊榜 (LangYaBang - or, Nirvana In Fire). The drama is SO GOOD. 1000/10 would recommend.</p><p>Anyway, I hope y'all enjoyed this chapter! Thank you so much for leaving 'kudos' and your comments give me life. Also please check out @lial-draws on Tumblr - they posted this absolutely gorgeous art for this fic, and I think I'm in love. &lt;33333</p>

    <p>It’s late in the day, and the training yard is empty. Wei Ying has lived in Cloud Recesses long enough to know that most of the disciples are currently cooped up in afternoon classes, probably trying not to drift off to the sound of Old Man Lan’s incessant droning about rules and the ‘proper’ way to do things. Gods know Wei Ying himself had given into the impulse a few too many times, and received more than his fair share of reaming out because of it.</p><p>But Wei Ying is no longer a disciple, and so he’s been here for the past hour instead, taking advantage of the free space available to train and work on his cultivation level. Reincarnation was great and all, but Mo Xuanyu’s body was nowhere near the standard of his original one – either in muscle definition or golden core development. Or height, which is the one thing that truly aggravates Wei Ying about his new vessel. It only takes practice and a certain amount of time to make up for a low cultivation level, or a lack of muscles. But a lack of height? Not so much.</p><p>Eventually, Wei Ying tires of bashing practice dummies with <em>Suibian</em> and practicing forms he’d mastered in his teenage years – which, much to his dismay, Mo Xuanyu had never committed to muscle memory. So he packs up, puts everything away as neatly as he can, and sets off to find his husband.</p><p>In all honesty, Wei Ying thinks as he makes his way through the mostly-empty corridors, the two of them haven’t been spending as much time together lately. Lan Zhan is just so <em>busy</em> these days, what with the weeklong gathering Cloud Recesses is hosting, and he and Lan Qiren are basically running the entire thing by themselves. Yes, it may have been Wei Ying’s idea in the first place, but though he’s done his best to help out, there’s only so much of the burden he can take off his poor, overworked husband’s shoulders. Wei Ying’s skills, after all, lie mostly in killing things and controlling their spirits.</p><p>And so they barely see each other during the day, Wei Ying avoiding the visiting cultivators (most of whom likely want to sever his head from his body) and Lan Zhan spending hours in meetings and discussions with his uncle, coming back only at night. Just in time for them to collapse into bed together, and then wake up again for the cycle to start anew.</p><p>It’s a stark contrast to their usual days together: exchanging lazy kisses in the morning, sharing their meals with a table of gawping disciples and Lan Zhan’s uptight uncle glaring at the place where their fingers intertwine. Lan Zhan by his side, and Wei Ying by his.</p><p>He hates it. Okay, maybe ‘hate’ is a strong word. More like ‘severely dislike’. Yes, that’s better. Wei Ying <em>severely dislikes</em> not being able to see his husband for more than half an hour a day. It feels like a part of him is missing.</p><p>Much like the way he’d felt after his and Jiang Cheng’s argument the other day. Well, not exactly, seeing as Lan Zhan is his lover and Wei Ying would probably rather die than picture his brother doing half the things Wei Ying has allowed his husband to do to him. Not to mention that Lan Zhan would probably go ballistic and garotte Jiang Cheng with a shiny-new set of <em>guqin</em> strings.</p><p>But still.</p><p>It’s easy to joke about it now, to make light of his relationship with his brother after their reconciliation only hours ago. People have always said that Wei Ying moves on too fast, recovers from what should be major blows to his emotions and bounces back with a smile and a witticism at the ready. Maybe that’s true. Maybe he’s just as void of feeling as their idea of him. But Wei Ying’s jokes have always been of the ‘if-he-doesn’t-laugh-he’ll-cry’ variety, and humour has often been his only defense against tragedy.</p><p>He’d never tell Jiang Cheng this, but the last few days since the argument have been absolute hell. He barely slept, ate only when Lan Zhan or Sizhui forced him to, the words he and his brother had thrown back and forth at each other circling like carrion vultures inside his head.</p><p>Jiang Cheng, teeth bared, his hand on his sword in the pose Wei Ying has seen directed at so many members of the Wen clan. <em>It’s always like that with you – nothing’s ever enough</em>.</p><p>Himself, seeing red, his own hands balled into fists by his sides. <em>You’re even worse than I am.</em></p><p>Round and round it had gone, a veritable parade of insults that each tore a new hole in Wei Ying’s barely scabbed-over heart, interspersed with thoughts that never lessened the pain, only carved the wounds deeper and filled them with a cold black sludge.</p><p>
  <em>What if this is it? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>What if we never speak to each other again? </em>
</p><p>
  <em>What if the last thing I’ll ever say to my little brother is that he’s a monster?</em>
</p><p>The poisonous thoughts had consumed him, drowned him, made him barely able to breathe, because for all that Wei Ying has started a new life away from Yunmeng, Jiang Cheng has always been the one thing he could never let go of. The boy he grew up with. The man who fought by his side.</p><p>It took every ounce of courage he possessed to apologise after their fight. Wei Ying is a master of denial, and the fight had started over such a little thing, hadn’t it? A jar of wine. A good-natured prank.</p><p>Except it hadn’t been about the prank at all. No, that was just the catalyst, the last straw heaped on top of all the crap that was their fragile relationship, and it had crumbled under the strain, the bridge between them too weak to hold with all the water flowing against it. Wei Ying can admit now that this had been a long time coming, because putting on a smile for the world and pretending everything’s okay has never seemed to work out as well for him as he thinks it will.</p><p>He’s not going to make that mistake again this time, he promises himself. He’s not foolish enough to think that they’re going to go back to the way they were as teenagers now that they’re talking to each other again. And maybe it’ll take a while to get there, or maybe they never will, but if there’s one thing Wei Ying doesn’t know, it’s how to stop trying.</p><p>He turns a corner, and the pavilion where the sect meetings have been held the past few days comes into sight. The couple times Wei Ying has been here, the pavilion itself and the area around it have all been decently crowded, sect leaders milling about and talking to each other. At the moment, it’s empty, the meeting having ended hours before. But Lan Zhan’s got to be around here somewhere, discussing tomorrow’s gathering with Old Man Lan.</p><p>(Wei Ying conveniently forgets that his husband has reminded him countless times not to call his uncle that. It’s not like it’s important.)</p><p>“Lan Zhan! Lan Zhan!”, he calls, poking his head through the entrance to the pavilion. There’s no one in there, and he withdraws, pouting.</p><p>Then he hears a sound. Quiet, low, undulating, and he abruptly realises that it’s been there the whole time. He steps closer to the source of the noise. <em>Voices.</em> More than one; from the sound of it, they belong to adolescents.</p><p>He’s creeping around the edge of the pavilion – honestly, Wei Ying doesn’t even know why he’s bothering to be quiet, but it just feels like he should – when a shriek pierces the air.</p><p>“We’re <em>not</em> doing that!” The exclamation is pitched high and familiar. Wei Ying recognizes that voice – it’s Jin Ling’s. A frisson of confusion runs through him. What’s his nephew doing here?</p><p>There’s a pause, and then another person whines, “but you said you were in.” That’s Lan Jingyi. Wei Ying is getting more puzzled by the minute. ‘In’ on what? What the hell is going on?</p><p>“You did say that,” chimes in someone who sounds like Ah-Yuan, calm and reasonable as usual. Wei Ying spares a moment to think that his adopted son sounds very persuasive indeed, and he doesn’t even know the subject of conversation. No, he’s not being biased. Not at all.</p><p>He comes around the back of the circular building, where three teenagers are sprawled in the grass. Jin Ling is leaning on Ah-Yuan, who doesn’t seem to mind the younger boy’s added weight, his arm tucked contentedly over Jin Ling’s chest. Lan Jingyi, however, is lying on his stomach a few feet away, fiddling with a blade of grass.</p><p>All three of them seem deep in discussion. Or plotting. Yes, that’s more like it – they’re definitely plotting something. Wei Ying feels his curiosity prick, and flattens his back against the pavilion wall before they can notice him. He wants to hear this.</p><p>“Come on! The two of you can’t always be ganging up on me,” Jin Ling protests, giving Ah-Yuan’s arm a swat. “It’s not fair.”</p><p>Lan Jingyi rips the blade of grass into two.</p><p>“Well, he’s not wrong,” says Ah-Yuan, at the same time as Lan Jingyi opens his mouth to say, “ah, but life isn’t fair, Young Mistress Jin.”</p><p>To which Jin Ling promptly replies that Lan Jingyi can go and do something anatomically impossible with his <em>guqin</em>, and they devolve into petty squabbling. Poor Ah-Yuan looks on helplessly as his boyfriend and best friend toss insults at each other, unwilling to pick a side. He doesn’t even make a move to break it up – he’s probably too used to being in the middle of their arguments to even bother.</p><p><em>Kids.</em> A pang of nostalgia hits and Wei Ying smiles ruefully, remembering better times. Easier ones. But as much as he’d like to watch his son and nephew behave like children, it doesn’t look like they’ll get back on topic any time soon. And he really, <em>really</em> wants to know what they were talking about.</p><p>Stepping softly, Wei Ying peels himself off the wall and strides up to the three of them. For a moment, they’re so engaged in their arguing that they don’t even notice him.</p><p>“What’s all this about?”</p><p>The effect is immediate. The teenagers’ heads snap up, their eyes wide and spines suddenly ramrod-straight. Jin Ling’s mouth hangs open mid-sentence, whatever he was saying dying on his lips.</p><p><em>See?</em> Wei Ying thinks to himself. <em>I can totally command a room.</em></p><p>Sizhui recovers first, the shock on his face smoothing over to make way for a guileless smile. “Senior Wei!”</p><p>Lan Jingyi nods emphatically, even though Wei Ying notes with no small amount of amusement that the other boy hasn’t really said anything worth agreeing with. Then Jin Ling finds his voice.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”, he asks brusquely. The kid sounds so much like Jiang Cheng that Wei Ying has to suppress a snort. It’s all in the tone, really, and the arms crossed over his chest as though he’s either defending himself from something or gearing up to chew someone out. Possibly both.</p><p>At that, the snort finds its way out.</p><p>“Can’t I just drop by to visit my son and favourite nephew?” Then, glancing over at Lan Jingyi, “and my favourite troublemaker?”</p><p>Going by the looks on their faces, none of them are convinced.</p><p>“I’m your only nephew,” Jin Ling corrects.</p><p>Wei Ying waves his hand. “Semantics. Alright, fine,” he says. “If you <em>must</em> know, I was looking for Lan Zhan. Have you seen him anywhere?”</p><p>When the teenagers all shake their heads, he heaves a sigh. “We haven’t slept together in <em>days</em>,” he complains. “He promised every day.”</p><p>Jin Ling’s face contorts in an expression of horror. Slowly he edges himself behind Ah-Yuan, whose Lan Xichen-esque serene smile is beginning to peel around the edges.</p><p>Satisfaction blooms sweet in Wei Ying’s chest. He may no longer be able to hide behind Mo Xuanyu’s reputation of being a lunatic, but shamelessness has its benefits, and he’s always loved to watch other people squirm. Even his own relatives. <em>Especially</em> his own relatives.</p><p>(And maybe this will show Jin Ling that he has nothing to be ashamed of, loving Wei Ying and Lan Zhan’s son.)</p><p>He folds his legs and collapses onto the grass, bringing him level with the three teenagers. With a flicker of pride – tinged with annoyance –he notices that Ah-Yuan is now taller than him. But not by much.</p><p>“So,” he says, grinning brightly, “what have you boys been plotting?”</p>

        <blockquote class="userstuff">
          <p>Hey everybody! I'm back, with the last chapter before classes start for real tomorrow. I'm terrified, but well, life goes on. Here we have our first WWX-POV chapter, which I told myself I wouldn't write but I couldn't help myself. Apologies if it's OOC - I haven't really got a handle on WWX's personality, or at least what it's like to write it. Still, I hope you enjoyed this chapter.</p><p>Today's song is 'Iris' by the Goo-Goo Dolls, which is really sweet for Xicheng. I'm so excited today, because "Except For When I'm Missing You" just updated, and I'm saving it for after I post this chapter. WHEE!!!</p><p>I'd also like to share a couple more fic ideas - these are adapted from ideas for original stories, which I'm considering writing as fanfics in order to test reception. Please let me know if you'd like to read them!<br/>1. Messenger (my personal favourite)<br/>LXC is a regular high school kid. Really. Sure, his firefighter father died in a rescue when he was six, and he's been helping his mother raise his younger brother ever since, but that's totally normal. Until he meets JC, and finds out that it isn't. Because it wasn't a house fire that killed his father - it was a fire demon, and his father was a Messenger, a warrior who fights monsters from another world that normal people can't see. Oh, and apparently, LXC is one too.<br/>A bit of background: see, other than our own world, there's a world called Illiriya that exists outside of reality - the Dream World. It's where people's minds travel to when they dream, and they inhabit bodies called Munns in which they act out their dream sequences in the Dreamscapes of Illiriya. The problem is, Dreamscapes manufacture whatever people dream about, and so they're basically monster factories. Messengers are people born without Munns, who can physically cross between worlds and are tasked with hunting down and killing the monsters that escape to our world.<br/>JC is a Messenger. He's known it his whole life, ever since before his parents were murdered by one of their people gone rogue and he was taken in by LQR, the first Messenger (who trains the junior ones) and immortal Keeper of the Great Gate that connects reality and the Dream World. He's been waiting years to hunt down his parents' killer, and now that he's old enough, he can finally get revenge. Except LQR has a new recruit: a greenie named LXC, and he wants JC to put his plans on hold and help train him. Understandably, JC isn't exactly happy about this new arrangement.<br/>All of this gets put on the back-burner when WRH, the man who killed JC's parents, resurfaces, now leading an army of monsters to take control of the Great Gate. He captures LQR, his ex-mentor, so LXC and JC have to put aside their differences and work together to get back the man they both think of as a father figure. Oh, and maybe save the world in the process.<br/>It's a daunting task for two high-school-aged Messengers (one only barely half-trained), but luckily, they have help. Enter NMJ, LXC's Taekwondo-black-belted best friend who is accidentally able to see monsters after his Munn is killed; WWX, a powerful fire demon boy (self-dubbed JC's honorary brother) who was cast out of his clan due to his soft heart and lack of control over his powers, who also falls for LWJ, LXC's little brother. Also along for the ride is JGY, a very shady Dreamwalker (an immortal being with almost-limitless powers) who takes a liking to NMJ and figures LXC would be a good wing-man. WN and WQ are also present, as a Munn brother-sister monster-hunting duo.</p><p>2. Rules For Breaking Curses<br/>JC is nothing special. He's smart, sure, and decent at sports, but his only real skill is pissing people off, and the truly astounding number of crappy novels he can read in a day. Not exactly a talent his mother (and father) are impressed by. His brother, WWX, is by comparison, everything JC isn't. Nearly genius-level IQ, athletically and musically gifted and a social butterfly, WWX is practically perfect, however you look at it. So much so, in fact, that he is the lucky (read: unfortunate) soul chosen by a fairytale kingdom from another world to save them all.<br/>LXC is at the end of his rope. The Crown Prince of Gusu - a kingdom on the edge of destruction by a terrible curse - he's the most powerful mage in the kingdom, and hence the person who will have to perform the spell to bring over a person from our world. His kingdom's last hope, a Chosen Saviour from a world without magic, where all people are immune to the curse. He's under a lot of pressure to do this right, and a screw-up would have catastrophic consequences. But that's what happens. LXC messes up, and the spell grabs the wrong person: JC, the Chosen One's mediocre younger brother.<br/>Still, the curse is coming, and so LXC and JC have to go on a quest to stop it. Their secret weapon? JC's knowledge of novel tropes may not be so useless after all.</p><p>Thank you for reading! :)</p>

    <p>The next couple days pass quietly, without incident. Jiang Cheng trains in the mornings, attends meetings and scolds his nephew. Wei Wuxian meets him for breakfast before the conferences start, where the Yunmeng Jiang sect leader spends one or two very awkward hours trying not to gag on his porridge as his older brother steadily inches closer and closer to his husband throughout the meal, eventually ending up half-seated on his lap.</p><p>They trade barbs and tease each other, and Jiang Cheng and the second Jade of the Gusu Lan sect have a couple staredowns (which Lan Wangji somehow manages to win every time, the bastard) while Wei Wuxian eggs them both on by turns and gives Hanguang-Jun some downright filthy kisses when Jiang Cheng looks away first.</p><p>It’s… it’s good.</p><p>Nothing like what they had before, of course. Back when Lan Wangji was barely a smudge in the picture, and mornings were filled with Ah-Niang’s sword drills and the smell of lotuses that always accompanied Ah-Jie’s cooking. When Jiang Cheng didn’t wear his mother’s ring around his finger because it was on hers instead; didn’t twist it every time Wei Wuxian came a little too close. But it’s good, because even though their conversations can get awkward, at least they’re not <em>tense</em>.</p><p>And once, Wei Wuxian insists that the children join them and it’s even better. Jin Ling holds hands with Lan Sizhui under the table; though Jiang Cheng still doesn’t entirely approve of his nephew’s choice in men, he allows himself to smirk when Lan Jingyi complains about being a perpetual third wheel. Then when Wei Wuxian makes a snide comment about <em>Jiang Cheng’s</em> “questionable relationship status”, he kicks his brother in the shin.</p><p>If his smirk grows into a real smile at the indignant screech that follows, then that’s nobody’s business but his.</p><p>He visits Lan Xichen in the afternoons, too. Ducks out after meetings and makes his way to the little cottage, avoiding Wei Wuxian’s smug grins and the judgemental looks Jin Ling’s inherited from his father.</p><p>The other man is usually doing paperwork in his living room when Jiang Cheng arrives, but one day Jiang Cheng finds him on his knees in the garden, pruning the dead leaves off a bush full of peonies. He always smiles at Jiang Cheng, sets down whatever it is he’s doing right then and stands to make tea for them both. Then Jiang Cheng gives his report and they spend hours talking about everything and nothing at the same time.</p><p>And that’s… that’s good too.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>It’s the sixth day of the conference – the second-last day Jiang Cheng is scheduled to be at Cloud Recesses – when he broaches the topic of cultivation.</p><p>They’re in Lan Xichen’s living room, sheafs of paper in neat piles on the floor, the two of them sharing the Gusu Lan sect leader’s ridiculously tiny wooden desk as they work their way through their respective stacks of paperwork. They’ve been here for the past hour now, content to work in silence in each other’s company. It’s definitely not the longest Jiang Cheng’s ever spent settling administrative matters and he’s normally a very focused person, but the question has been gnawing at him for days now.</p><p>“How do you train?”, he asks, taking advantage of a lull in the other man’s concentration in which he has to re-wet his calligraphy brush with ink. “Here, I mean. There’s no one to spar with.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng realises too late that that’s probably not the most tactful thing to say to a man whose old sparring partner was most likely murdered by one of his best friends, and clenches his fingers around his own brush. “Never mind. Forget I said anything.”</p><p>Lan Xichen gives a soft, sad smile, and Jiang Cheng feels like kicking himself. “No, it’s all right. It’s a good question.” He sets down his brush with barely any sound at all.</p><p>“I <em>do </em>cultivate, if that’s what you’re asking,” he answers wryly. “And yes, it is more difficult to train…alone than to spar with another person. But I make do, since as you said, there is no one around.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng waits a moment, but the older man shows no sign of going back to his pile of forms. He’s simply looking at Jiang Cheng, watching as if to see what will happen next.</p><p>“How, then?”, he repeats, his curiosity finally getting the better of him. Lan Xichen seems like a very neat person – the quick glimpse Jiang Cheng had of his bedroom <em>that night</em> is a testament to that – but training equipment, targets, dummies and the like, take space to store. Time to maintain. And Jiang Cheng has seen neither hide nor hair of any one of those things.</p><p>The other sect leader shrugs. “Simple exercises, mostly. Small things, like doing handstands, medidating, running through sword forms. Playing the <em>guqin</em>.”</p><p>He shrugs again, the gesture casual and unbefitting someone of his status. Jiang Cheng would know. His mother spent weeks – and countless scoldings – training him out of the habit. Yet somehow, Lan Xichen makes it look elegant. Then he blinks.</p><p>“Oh, yes; and Liebing as well,” he says, referring to his <em>xiao</em>. The jade flute that is his secondary weapon, a contrast to the <em>guqin</em> favoured by his uncle and brother, and the rest of his sect. Jiang Cheng frowns.</p><p>Liebing is one of Lan Xichen’s most prized possessions. It’s the only one of the myriad instruments he plays to have a name, and he keeps it on his bedside table. Right next to where he sleeps. Yet the statement about his <em>xiao</em> seems almost like an afterthought, tacked on as though he’d only barely remembered it was there.</p><p>There’s something jarringly wrong about that, about Lan Xichen nearly forgetting to mention his flute in favour of his unnamed <em>guqin</em>. Liebing – one of the things that sets him apart from the rest of his family; one of the things that marks him as <em>him</em>.</p><p>There’s something wrong about it, but Jiang Cheng can’t see what it is. Cold wisps begin to gather in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Then he notices Lan Xichen is looking at him strangely, head tilted to the side and liquid gold eyes studying his expression. With an effort, he shakes away the odd cloud that seems to hang inside him.</p><p>“How long has it been since you sparred with a partner?”</p><p>The other man pauses, considering. “A little over a year,” he says finally.</p><p><em>Huh</em>. That’s surprising. “Not even with your brother?”</p><p>“Wangji never offered.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng refrains from saying ‘<em>you could have asked</em>’. He can read the reply to that well enough in the slight slump of Lan Xichen’s shoulders. The other man doesn’t want to ask for anything, any help. Even if it’s from his family.</p><p><em>Now, where have I heard that before?</em>, his subconscious snipes. Jiang Cheng tells it to be quiet if it’s not even going to stay on the topic at hand.</p><p><em>Especially</em> if the help is from his family, Jiang Cheng realises. Lan Wangji is so settled in, so happy being married to Jiang Cheng’s older brother, so very content to spend every waking moment with Wei Wuxian after thirteen years of waiting. Lan Xichen doesn’t want to be a burden.</p><p><em>That’s bullshit,</em> Jiang Cheng thinks before he can stop himself. <em>You could never be a burden</em>.</p><p>Maybe he should say it. Maybe Lan Xichen needs to hear it. But Jiang Cheng doesn’t say things like that. Hell, he doesn’t even think them. What the hell is wrong with him right now?</p><p>“Do you miss it?”, he asks instead.</p><p>“…A little.” Then a beat, a sigh. And after that, the truth. “<em>Yes</em>.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng weighs his options. Honestly, for all his pushing, he’s not sure what to do with this information now that he’s got it. No – that’s a lie; he’s just being a pussy. There’s really only one thing he can do.</p><p>He gets to his feet, holds his hand out to the other man still sitting puzzled on the floor.</p><p>“Spar with me?”</p><p>Lan Xichen takes his hand. The paperwork can wait.</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Jiang Wanyin lunges at him, sword point level with his heart, and Lan Huan leaps backwards to block it. Shuoyue comes up, meeting Sandu and twisting it aside almost before Lan Huan can think about it. The sword moves like an extension of his arm, slicing precise arcs through the air, dancing and striking like a snake. Blood hums in Lan Huan’s veins, pounds in his ears. His world narrows to two swords, the man in front of him and the small circle of grass that is their battlefield.</p><p>He is alive with it. And that is what he feels right now, a weapon in his hand, matching his skills and strength with an opponent whose ability matches his own. He has not felt like this in a long time.</p><p>Lan Huan launches a counter attack of his own, and they devolve into a flurry of blows, each trying to slip around the other’s defenses, to land a strike faster than the other can block it. There is none of the ring of naked steel that Lan Huan has come to expect from his bouts with other cultivators. Instead, the air is uncommonly silent, both of them having wrapped their blades in cloth before their sparring began.</p><p>It is not a practice popular among cultivators. The extra weight tends to unbalance the sword some, and fighting with padded blades carries a decidedly lower level of drama to it, but Lan Huan finds it is one he prefers. Neither he nor Jiang Wanyin truly has the wish to hurt each other, and so dulling their blades allows them to spar no-holds-barred. To come at each other with everything they have, holding nothing back, and not worry about injuring the other.</p><p>Lan Huan is tired of worrying about hurting people.</p><p>Indeed, he thinks as the younger sect leader pulls off a particularly convincing feint and manages to slip his sword under Lan Huan’s guard – which Lan Huan only blocks at the last second – he doesn’t have to, with Jiang Wanyin. The two of them have fought side-by-side before. During the Sunshot Campaign, back in the Nightless City; when they were travelling together, amassing an army to take on the Qishan Wen sect. Ever since they were young, Lan Huan has always known that Jiang Wanyin is a good fighter. There’s a reason they call him ‘Sandu-Shengshou’, after all: the Sacred Hand of the Three Poisons.</p><p>But fighting beside him is different from fighting <em>against </em>him, and Lan Huan wonders why he’s never considered it before. He’s never considered a lot of things about Jiang Wanyin, actually. Still, this is something he should have seen.</p><p>The man moves like a hurricane, a relentless volley of blows that never seems to stop, each strike swift and powerful and nearly as precise as Lan Huan’s own. He fights like rage personified, at times cold and calculating, and others burning with heat. And this is with just his sword. Zidian remains a silver ring on his right index finger, as per the terms of their agreement not to bring their secondary weapons into the mix.</p><p>Lan Huan is beginning to realise that nothing about Jiang Wanyin is ‘just’ anything.</p><p>It’s exhilarating, fighting with him. Their styles are so different: Lan Huan knows his own is by the book, technically perfect – or so his uncle has said – and preferring skill and precision to power. Jiang Wanyin is a wildfire, devastating and seemingly uncontrollable, as though he’s perpetually sunken into the sort of battlelust-trance he’s seen in warriors pushed past their limits.</p><p>Lan Huan knew someone who fought like that, once. Like he could cut down everyone in his path with the force of his fury alone. He had been great. And then he sank into that trance and it wouldn’t give him up, and he never came out the other side.</p><p>A cold jolt of fear runs down Lan Huan’s spine. He hesitates for a moment, his sword slowing mid-swing as its momentum carries it forward without the power of his arm behind it. It’s all the opening his opponent needs to strike at Lan Huan’s unprotected side. The blade is coming faster than Lan Huan can even see; it’s that which snaps him into action. His brain starts working again and his instincts take over.</p><p>And they decide: to hell with Lan technique and skill. To hell with honour and perfection – those things might keep him safe enough in the cultivation world, but it was the back-alley brawls he’d fought in with Meng Yao by his side that <em>truly </em>taught him to survive.</p><p>In a world without honour…</p><p>Victory is all there is.</p><p>He throws himself to the side, hitting the grass. But it doesn’t matter because at the same time, he kicks his legs out and sweeps in a circle, taking Jiang Wanyin by surprise and knocking him to the ground too.</p><p>The other man recovers quickly; he’s no stranger to fighting dirty either. And then they’re on each other, trading blows at a speed Lan Huan has only experienced with <em>one</em> other person when not in the heat of battle. His vision tunnels and blurs all at the same time, and suddenly the man facing him is different.</p><p>Violet robes are replaced with black edged in gold, shoulders broadening, hair flowing loose from a ponytail instead of tied tight in a bun. The nose is stronger – more hawk-like – eyes flinty and deeper-set beneath thicker brows.</p><p>It’s Chifeng-Zun, Lan Huan’s First Sworn Brother. His Nie-Dage. Lan Huan’s breath catches in his chest; his throat closes around nothing.</p><p>And for a moment, time stops and everything exists around Lan Huan at once. Every possibility, every memory, every dream he’s ever had, and Nie Mingjue is right there, brandishing that saber that Lan Huan can barely even <em>lift</em>. There’s a smile curving his mouth, normally set so stern in daily life, the one he reserves for Lan Huan. The one that says <em>you and I, we are as good as each other</em>, and <em>let me give you what you need</em>.</p><p>And Lan Huan’s response is always, always, <em>I already have it</em>.</p><p>He can feel it, taste it there on his tongue, and he wants to say it badly. So badly. But then the world spins back into focus, the earth shifts under him and it’s not his Nie-Dage, but Jiang Wanyin whose sword is pressed against his ribs. Whose neck is at the point of Lan Huan’s own blade.</p><p>“A stalemate,” whispers Lan Huan. Their heads are bowed so close together that the other man can hear him anyway. Jiang Wanyin nods once, careful not to scrape Shuoyue along the fragile skin of his neck. He swallows and his throat bobs.</p><p>“In a real fight, we’d both be dead,” is his answer. Delivered in a quiet voice, rough like it’s been scraped along gravel.</p><p>The pressure of Sandu is gentle along his ribs, but it is there nonetheless. Lan Huan can feel it when he breathes.</p><p>“It would appear so.”</p><p>“You’re shaking,” Jiang Wanyin says in response. His eyes travel up to Lan Huan’s own – away from where his sword point meets the fabric of Lan Huan’s robes – and they’re blue, not black. The colour of the sky a little after sunset instead of at midnight.</p><p>Lan Huan realises that he’s right. Only the discovery doesn’t do much for him; he’s suddenly achingly exhausted, as though all the energy he managed to muster up for their sparring session has drained out of his bones. He can’t even bring himself to be shocked. Not when it feels like there’s something quaking right in the core of him, and he’s shaking so hard he fears he might come apart at the seams. Just split, like a rag doll filled to bursting with the tiny beans his mother used to stuff them with.</p><p>Perhaps it might feel better. Lan Huan doesn’t know. He’s so <em>tired</em>.</p><p>He can’t hold his arm up anymore; Shuoyue falls to the ground with a muffled ‘thud’. And then every bone in his body turns to liquid and he begins to fall too, unable to keep himself upright. But he doesn’t hit the ground.</p><p>Instead, another sword drops to the grass, and Lan Huan is surrounded by warmth. Steadied by the weight of someone else’s arms around him. It’s <em>Jiang Wanyin</em>, smaller than him but so very fierce, not fearless but <em>brave</em>, and Lan Huan sags into his hold. Goes limp because he can, and there’s someone there who will let Lan Huan lean on him without asking. Who will catch him – has already caught him – without offering first.</p><p>And Lan Huan lets himself fall apart.</p>

          <p>Welcome back everybody!!! I've missed you all - and this fic - so much. It's been a week, classes have started, and I'm drowning under all the work I have not done. Yes, I spent the whole of my Sunday writing and reading fanfiction instead of studying. I'm a great role model. (Don't be like me, kids.)</p><p>Anyway, this super-long chapter puts us at over 100k words! *Screaming in the distance* It's officially a longfic. And I mean longest of the longs. This baby is at least twice anything I've ever written, and possibly the thing I'm most proud of. Also, please go read Hamliet's beautiful fic "Thank You, And I'm Sorry". It gives me the XiCheng feels so hard and I love it.</p><p>This chapter's recommended song is "Holding Back The Fire" by Michael Schulte, which is partly the inspiration for this title. I think it's a very LXC song, especially post-canon, the poor boy. He needs a hug very badly indeed.</p><p>About the content of the chapter: I'm sorry if it feels like one big mood swing. The tone changed almost completely in the latter portion, and I don't even know why. I wasn't really expecting to write that, honestly, but I felt like it was time we delved into the LXC angst proper, especially his reaction to JGY and NMJ, and the delayed proper mourning he's going to give his sworn brothers now that he knows the truth. You can read this sort of shippy-like if you've got your shipping goggles on; if not, it can remain more or less platonic to you. I personally headcanon that LXC had a "thing" with NMJ - if not a full-fledged relationship than at least sort of a two-way crush, since we all know that NMJ was *weak* for LXC and would do almost anything he asked. So, yeah, that would make the whole big reveal really hard on him. But as I said, everyone can read this differently. I'm mostly a NMJ/JGY shipper myself (I don't even really know why).</p><p>Thank you all for reading, and see you next time!!!! :)) &lt;3</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng can feel the other man shaking. Full-body tremors that wrack him where he’s pressed against Jiang Cheng, his face turned into Jiang Cheng’s shoulder. It can’t be comfortable; Lan Xichen is an inch or two taller than him, and Jiang Cheng’s arms are thrown awkwardly around his torso so that the man’s own arms are flattened to his sides.</p>
<p>Then he feels it. Hears it, too. A dampness seeping through the cloth of his sleeve, muffled hitches of breath, quiet and bitten back. Sobs. Muffled but there.</p>
<p>Lan Xichen is crying.</p>
<p>The bottom drops out of Jiang Cheng’s stomach, and something twists in his chest that feels like it might be his heart. Oh, hell. Lan Xichen is fucking <em>crying</em>. It’s not even the first time Jiang Cheng’s seen it – and isn’t that sick, that he’s seen the ever-optimistic, always-smiling leader of the Lan sect shed tears not once but <em>twice</em> – but this is infinitely worse than watching him wipe discreetly at his eyes. Because now he’s sobbing into Jiang Cheng’s shoulder, enough that his fucking sleeve is wet, and Jiang Cheng doesn’t know how to fix this.</p>
<p>Hell, he doesn’t even know how <em>this</em> started. One moment they were sparring, and he’d felt absolutely amazing, on top of the world, and he could tell the other man was experiencing the same adrenaline rush. And then he was just gone. His eyes went vacant, and Jiang Cheng’s seen enough people scarred permanently from war to recognize when someone is somewhere outside their body, seeing something other than what’s in front of them.</p>
<p>Lan Xichen had sagged like a puppet whose strings were cut, and if Jiang Cheng hadn’t reacted, hadn’t caught him in time, he’d have hit the ground and gone rag-doll-limp. Flopped there on the ground like he didn’t care that he’d fallen, and there’s probably some sort of metaphor there that Jiang Cheng’s too thick-headed to pick up on, but all he knows is that it’s <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>What the fuck is he supposed to do?</p>
<p>The other man lets out another shuddering sob, and Jiang Cheng pushes his panic to the back of his mind, firmly ignoring the nagging voice that reminds him that he’s absolute <em>shit</em> at comforting people.</p>
<p><em>This isn’t about you</em>, he tells himself sternly. The voice is right, though. Just ask Jin Ling. Half the time he’d tried to soothe his nephew’s childhood scrapes and bruises, he just ended up making the kid cry harder. And whatever Lan Xichen is so obviously suffering from right now, it’s not a fucking grazed knee.</p>
<p>Jiang Cheng pats the older man’s back with one hand, as soothing and un-awkward as he can make it. For a while, they just stand there like that. The taller sect leader’s legs are jelly, Jiang Cheng thinks, because his knees are still buckled and he’s a dead weight leaning on Jiang Cheng, who’s the only one keeping both of them upright at this point. It’s uncomfortable as anything, but he can’t move. Not right now.</p>
<p>Eventually, the other man gets his shaky feet back under him. Stands up using Jiang Cheng’s arm as a support and pulls back slowly, scrubbing at his face ineffectually with the end of one wide sleeve.</p>
<p>Now that it’s no longer buried in Jiang Cheng’s shoulder, he can finally get a good look at Lan Xichen’s face. It’s obvious that he’s been crying. His cheeks are damp, those amber eyes glassy with a sheen of tears, and there’s a crease on his forehead where it pressed too hard into the seam of Jiang Cheng’s robes.</p>
<p>An “are you okay” is on the tip of Jiang Cheng’s tongue, but it dies before it can reach the open air, because the answer is already perfectly fucking obvious to anyone with two brain cells to rub together. Nothing about this is okay. Nothing at all.</p>
<p>So he waits. For Lan Xichen, who turns to the side as if to hide his face, as though Jiang Cheng doesn’t have a drying wet spot on his robes from Lan Xichen’s tears. As though he can pretend nothing happened.</p>
<p>He knows what Ah-Jie would do if she were here. <em>You don’t have to hide</em>, she’d say, voice gentle like the ocean, a wave that washed away worries and concerns like lines etched in the sand.</p>
<p>And then she’d put her hand on his shoulder or face, or pull him into a hug. The right kind this time – the proper kind.</p>
<p>But Jiang Cheng isn’t his older sister. Doesn’t have her patience or calm demeanor, as much as he wishes he did. He isn’t kind like her, either. He gets frustrated too easily, loses his temper and ends up making everything worse. The best thing he can do for Lan Xichen is keep his mouth shut and wait.</p>
<p>It is Lan Xichen’s show, after all.</p>
<p>It’s a solid minute before the other man gathers the composure to turn back to face him again, and another thirty seconds before he removes his hand from his face so Jiang Cheng can see the lingering traces of salt-water hanging heavy on his lashes.</p>
<p>There is a pang of something Jiang Cheng can’t name.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you had to see that,” Lan Xichen says finally, voice quavery like a newborn foal just learning to stand. He clasps his hands together at the front of his robes. The knuckles go white within seconds. “It was inappropriate–”</p>
<p>“<em>Shut up</em>.”</p>
<p>The vehemence with which Jiang Cheng cuts him off surprises the both of them. Gold eyes widen at his words. Somehow, though, beneath the shock of his own runaway mouth, Jiang Cheng finds the drive to continue. Or perhaps it’s just that he can’t stop himself.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare say that. Don’t you dare apologise. Don’t fucking act like you’re worth <em>less</em> because you let yourself cry.”</p>
<p>(<em>You massive fucking hypocrite</em>.)</p>
<p>“I–” Lan Xichen’s voice hitches. “I’m sorry,” he finally gets out, visibly taken aback. Jiang Cheng glares at him some more.</p>
<p>“What was that?!”, he hisses back. “You scared the shit out of me!”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t my intention. I’m–”</p>
<p>“I swear, if you say ‘I’m sorry’ one more time, I’m going to break both your legs. Now answer the gods-damned question.”</p>
<p>The other man blinks. Then, soft as a whisper, “it’s nothing. Really. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>He manages a smile, but it’s watery as hell and faker than Madame Jin’s eyelashes. Jiang Cheng sees through it in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>“Really,” he repeats, skepticism heavy in his voice. “You were crying over nothing. You collapsed because you’re <em>fine</em>.”</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of Jiang Cheng’s mind, he registers that this is a <em>really</em> bad idea. Lan Xichen obviously doesn’t want to talk about this; would rather deny something that happened less than five minutes ago than allow it to be brought up again. And it’s selfish, so selfish – even worse than what Wei Wuxian did to him all those years ago – but he has to know. Because he remembers the way his brain whited out in fear when Lan Xichen broke down, how he hadn’t even <em>thought</em> about it and his arms shot out to catch the other man when he started to fall. He needs to know.</p>
<p>If Lan Xichen doesn’t get this out of him, it’s going to break him. And Jiang Cheng can’t let that happen.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” the other sect leader insists again. How could Jiang Cheng ever have mistaken him for a saint? He wants to throttle him.</p>
<p>“Like hell you are. Now spill, before I <em>make</em> you.”</p>
<p align="center"> </p>
<hr/>
<p align="center"> <br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lan Huan wants to laugh at the absurdity of the situation. Sandu-Shengshou trying to threaten him into talking about his feelings. If he’d been told two years ago that this is what his life would be like, he wouldn’t have believed it.</p>
<p>But he’s not lying – that’s the thing. He’s fine. Absolutely and completely fine. There’s nothing wrong with him.</p>
<p><em>Great. Now you’re even lying to yourself</em>, a voice whispers in his ear. <em>That’s a violation of sect rule five hundred and six. And sect rule one thousand four hundred and thirty-seven. </em></p>
<p>
  <em>My, my. What would your uncle think?</em>
</p>
<p>Lan Huan doesn’t even have to ask himself that question. The answer is already laid out for him, in the tightness of Shu-Fu’s mouth the few times he has come to visit; in the stony look in his eyes when he fixes them on Lan Huan. It always sends shivers down Lan Huan’s spine, because behind the worry and the concern for his wellbeing, he can see his uncle’s disappointment. His resignation.</p>
<p>
  <em>It didn’t matter how hard he tried with you, did it? You’ve turned out just like your father.</em>
</p>
<p>He can feel himself beginning to fracture. There’s something building in his chest, something awful and splintered, and his eyes feel hot again.</p>
<p>Why is Jiang Wanyin doing this? Why is he pushing so hard at the walls Lan Huan has so painstakingly erected around his still-battered heart? Doesn’t he know that the dam could break?</p>
<p>But then, the voice reminds him, the walls are already cracked, have been since the moment Lan Huan built them. The water is leaking in, slowly and inexorably, and sooner or later Lan Huan is going to drown in it.</p>
<p>Perhaps he’d rather it be sooner.</p>
<p>He closes his eyes, but they burn anyway behind his eyelids. He’s such a coward. Nie Mingjue would be so disappointed; he loathed cowardice more than almost anything else. It was one of the reasons he and Ah-Yao were always fighting. If he could see Lan Huan now, would he hate him too?</p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin hates cowards as well. Does he think that Lan Huan is disgusting? Lan Huan never wanted to be weak. He never wanted anyone to see him cry.</p>
<p>The thing in his chest crawls up into his throat. And Lan Huan knows there’s nothing there – not really – but it’s so heavy that his throat goes tight with it and suddenly he can’t draw enough air into his lungs. It feels like walls are closing in on him, like his arms and legs are cramped in on each other, which is ridiculous because they’re out in the yard and he’s standing up straight and <em>holy gods in heaven the air is running out and he can’t breathe–</em></p>
<p>Loud noise pounds in his ears. His mind shutting down, shriveling up like a fruit left to dry in the sun and retreating back into his body. Down, down down…</p>
<p>His legs weaken – from lack of air? – and then he’s not standing anymore, but sitting on a hard surface. His knees drawn up to his chest, head tucked between them, trying to make himself small so maybe the tiny box he’s trapped in will feel a bit bigger.</p>
<p>He can feel every bit of it, but it’s like it’s happening to someone else. The only thing that seems real is the burning in his lungs and the ugly thing inside his chest that refuses to go away.</p>
<p>A voice cuts through the haze.</p>
<p>“Holy shit, what’s wrong?” It’s familiar and it’s coming from next to him, but it sounds far away, like someone talking through a tube. “Oh fucking gods I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to – tell me what’s wrong. Just talk to me. Say something.”</p>
<p>Desperation. The voice is filled with it, and there’s an answering pull in Lan Huan’s chest that makes it go even tighter.<em> No air no air no air–</em></p>
<p>There are two hands on his shoulders and the voice is speaking again. It sounds calmer now, steady like a rock in a current, the river parting around it.</p>
<p>“Just breathe, all right? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>Lan Huan wants to say ‘yes’ but that requires air he doesn’t have. The thought sends him spiraling again, panicking because he can’t even say anything right now. He can’t speak and he’s useless, can’t respond to such a basic question; can’t do anything worthwhile at all.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. That was a stupid question.” Is it? Isn’t this his fault? The thought that it might not be boggles Lan Huan’s oxygen-starved brain. “Nod if you can hear me.”</p>
<p>With difficulty, Lan Huan complies.</p>
<p>“Good. You’re good. Now just <em>breathe</em>, okay? You’re going to be fine. Just listen to my voice, and you’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>The hands start to rub circles into Lan Huan’s back, and the voice begins to count. <em>One, two, three</em>, all the way to ten, with pauses in between before starting all over from the beginning. It’s an effort for Lan Huan to slow his ragged gasps for breath, to get them under control enough to match them with the numbers, but he tries.</p>
<p>He wants to be fine. He wants it so badly.</p>
<p>The voice is like an anchor, that rock in the raging current and Lan Huan is a boat, the rope between them the only thing keeping him from drifting away. And slowly, he begins to come back to himself.</p>
<p>The first thing he registers when his consciousness resettles where it’s supposed to be is that the voice does, in fact, belong to someone he knows. Jiang Wanyin. Which isn’t much of a surprise, now that he thinks about it, because Jiang Wanyin was indeed the person Lan Huan was talking to before…well, before.</p>
<p>The second thing is that the other man is crouched down beside him. The hands on Lan Huan’s shoulders hadn’t been a figment of his imagination, another hallucination manufactured by his own wretched mind.</p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin seems to notice when Lan Huan’s breathing finally evens out, because the hands still and turn awkward. Despite this, he lingers a few moments longer before pulling away.</p>
<p>It’s silly, but Lan Huan almost misses the contact. The grounding of it; the reassurance.</p>
<p>Instead of voicing that, he raises his head. Unfortunately, he does so too fast for his brain to keep up and so his vision goes dark for a second. He blinks the spots away and focuses on the man next to him.</p>
<p>Whatever he expects to see, the naked relief on the younger sect leader’s face isn’t it. It takes him by surprise. That expression is reserved for Jiang Wanyin’s nephew, and on rare occasions, his brother. Not Lan Huan. Never him.</p>
<p>“I’m so, so sorry.” Jiang Wanyin sounds utterly shaken. “I shouldn’t have pushed you; you were right not to want to talk about it. It– it was your business. I had no right to pry and–” he runs his hand over his face – “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>There is a pause filled only by silence. Lan Huan doesn’t know what to say. He could be angry. He <em>could</em> – the other man is correct in his statement that he had no right whatsoever to interrogate Lan Huan – and maybe he should, but he can’t muster up the energy.</p>
<p>And anyway, it wasn’t Jiang Wanyin who sent Lan Huan into a– a panic attack. <em>A fit</em>, his traitorous mind supplies. No, that was his own doing. His own weakness. He just isn’t strong enough to deal with his own emotions.</p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” he says finally, once he finds his voice again.</p>
<p>The other man’s expression shifts from shock to anger. Lan Huan doesn’t understand how he can change gears so quickly. It’s giving him whiplash.</p>
<p>“No it’s <em>not</em>,” he spits out, so venomously that Lan Huan feels as though he’s getting scolded rather than reassured. Which might perhaps be the point of the entire exercise. “You weren’t fucking <em>breathing</em>, Xichen. I thought you were going to pass out.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right.”</p>
<p>“Stop saying that! Stop trying to pretend you’re okay when you’re not. No one panics like that when everything’s fucking fine.” The other man is red-faced – and not from their sparring session earlier – his blue eyes wide and wild, alight with such strong emotion that it leaves Lan Huan’s head spinning. “You can’t just let me – let people walk all over you like this. You can’t keep bending over backwards to please everyone but yourself.”</p>
<p>“Get angry. Or – I don’t know – cry again or something. Just…don’t pretend like you don’t feel anything.”</p>
<p>As if on cue, Lan Huan feels tears gathering at the corners of his eyes. Gods above, why is he <em>crying</em> so much?</p>
<p>“When we were sparring,” he blurts out, “I– I saw him. Chifeng-Zun.”</p>
<p>The sect leader beside him freezes. “I told you, I was wrong. You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“No.” Lan Huan injects as much steel into his voice as he can in his sorry state. “No, you were right. I can’t keep– I have to say something. Or else I think I might go mad.”</p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin keeps quiet as Lan Huan tells him everything. It’s not smooth, of course; he pauses in too many places for that, but there’s really no good way to tell someone that your imagination hallucinated your dead older brother in their place. As Lan Huan talks, the tension radiating off the other man becomes almost palpable.</p>
<p>“I see him everywhere,” he confesses, voice now a whisper. “I want it to stop.”</p>
<p><em>And I don’t want it to stop. Not if it means never seeing him again. I don’t know what I want.</em> No, that’s not quite right. “I want him back.”</p>
<p><em>I want him to be alive again. I want him to never have died in the first place. I want things to go back to the way they were</em>.</p>
<p>A flicker of gold edges at his memory: Ah-Jue frowning, arms crossed defensively over his chest as he let Lan Huan convince him to let Ah-Yao play the <em>guqin</em> to calm him. The strange smile that had tugged at Ah-Yao’s face when he finally acquiesced. Lan Huan had thought it simple satisfaction at the time, but now that he revisits the memory there is an oily edge to it. A sheen of victory that should have been out of place on the face of a brother.</p>
<p><em>I want things to go back to the way I thought they were</em>.</p>
<p>“I know,” is his response. Coming from anyone else, it would feel false. But Lan Huan remembers the rumours that ran wild for thirteen years, following the other man wherever he went, about the demonic cultivators Jiang Wanyin took back to Lotus Pier. Just because maybe – just maybe – one of them might be <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>And the flute, too. Chenqing, the one everyone thought was a trophy of his triumph against an enemy, but was really so much more than that. A memorial.</p>
<p>There’s no ‘but’ that follows Jiang Wanyin’s statement. No ‘it’s been over a decade already, you should have moved on by now’ that no one says, but Lan Huan can feel hiding behind their bowed heads and sympathetic smiles.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t just a brother to you, was he?”, the other man asks. The implication is hidden unspoken in his words. Lan Huan freezes, because nobody knows this, not even Shu-Fu. Not even Wangji.</p>
<p>His throat is dry as he looks at Jiang Wanyin. There is no judgement there, only a fragile sort of softness that Lan Huan has caught glimpses of over the past few days. The kind of emotion that most people believe the Jiang sect leader incapable of.</p>
<p>“No, he wasn’t,” he replies.</p>
<p>Nie Mingjue had been a brother to Lan Huan. But he’d also been his childhood crush, his best friend. His first love.</p>
<p>“That fucking sucks.”</p>
<p>Lan Huan blinks, and something wet rolls down his cheek. He lets out a laugh but it comes out halfway to a sob, and it’s such a <em>perfect</em> symbol of everything he’s become. He can’t hold back anymore, suddenly his tears are falling like rain, and he wants to be ashamed enough to stop them but he can’t. He guesses he doesn’t have as much control over his emotions as he thought he did.</p>
<p>A handkerchief is pressed into his hand and Jiang Wanyin inches over almost imperceptibly. Just so his knee touches Lan Huan’s side where he’s still hunched in on himself like he can make himself small enough that the world will forget he’s there. There’s no excuse this time, of having to catch him as he falls or steady him when he stumbles. This touch is purely meant to offer comfort.</p>
<p>As Lan Huan cries, and the other man stays, silent, beside him, it’s clear that Lan Huan was wrong, seeing Nie Mingjue in Jiang Wanyin. For all their similarities, their gruffness and viciousness in battle, their guarded smiles and the tiny, subtle shows of feeling that can only be seen if one knows where to look, they’re different. As much as Lan Huan loved his brother, Nie Mingjue only ever saw the world in black and white, only ever split people into heroes and villains. There was no in-between for him. No room for bad people to do good deeds, for a righteous man to make a mistake that cost an innocent their life.</p>
<p>What was it that Jiang Wanyin said?</p>
<p><em>You can’t keep bending over backwards to please everyone but yourself</em>.</p>
<p>Isn’t that what Lan Huan is doing? Always asking himself what Shu-Fu would think of him, what his father would think, what Wangji would think. What Nie Mingjue would think. His elder brother has been his standard for so long, the yardstick by which Lan Huan measures right and wrong.</p>
<p>As a child, Lan Huan thought Nie Mingjue perfect. He looked up to the older boy, idolized him even. And now… Now it’s been twelve years going on thirteen, and Lan Huan is discovering that time and the tragic circumstances of his death have built the man up in his mind, flawless and towering, larger than life. But righteous as he was, Nie Mingjue had his own weaknesses. He wasn’t perfect; not by a long shot.</p>
<p>And Lan Huan doesn’t have to be either.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Notes:</h3>
        <blockquote class="userstuff">
          <p>Hey my people!!! I'm back with chapter forty-four, the longest chapter to date with upwards of three thousand and six hundred words. Holy crow. Sorry about the fact that this is low-key a wreck because I wrote it without any clear idea of where I wanted it to go (I'm noticing a pattern in my author's notes here), but here you go.</p><p>So trigger warning: in this chapter, LXC has a panic attack. I'm sorry if I've handled this insensitively or inaccurately, since I've never had one; if there are inaccuracies, please point them out to me and I will fix them. I don't want to hurt anyone with this.<br/>That said, on to a mini-essay about the things that happen in this chapter. Here, JC gets pushy and forces LXC to talk about what caused him to break down in the previous chapter. Personally, I'm not sure about the wiseness of this move - he probably shouldn't have done this, especially since LXC was so uncomfortable with sharing - but I thought keeping quiet and giving LXC space wouldn't have been in-character. JC is a pushy and controlling person, and also pretty aggressive, so if something like this happens to someone he cares about, he's going to butt his way in and force them to talk about it. I think. I could be completely misreading his character, especially since he's someone who doesn't like to talk about his problems. But maybe he's okay with aggressively solving other people's. My beautiful hypocrite. At least he knows it. Also, for LXC himself, he gets a little/a lot introspective about his view of NMJ as a person as opposed to a memory, and how that in turn relates to him. Maybe this is unrealistic, that he'd have such a realisation, but in this fanfic, I try to have at least one learning point for the characters per chapter (which is why it's titled and chaptered like an instruction manual), and I felt like that was something LXC needed to have addressed. Because by all accounts in the story, he's basically the perfect character. The perfect nephew, brother, sect leader, cultivator, whatever - he's got all these expectations he has to fulfil and holds himself to a set of impossibly high standards that he's somehow managed to adhere to so far. But this is just setting himself up for a spectacular fall later on (aka after the Guanyin temple thing). And so through this fic, I'd like to address at least some of those issues. In this chapter, it's seeing other people as perfect and having to measure up. He's still got a boatload of other problems related to his 'perfectionist complex' which I think I'll tackle later, but this is it for today. As for his issues regarding JGY, we're working up to it. He's still not ready to open that can of worms yet. So far, we've gone through NHS and NMJ; next up will be JGY and after that, the big one: his daddy issues.<br/>As a side note, thus far, this story has mostly been a mix of JC angst and LXC h/c. As in, almost of JC's problems have been talked about but very few have actually been addressed. But don't worry, we'll get to that too. Eventually.</p><p>Alright, rant over. I have a lot of songs I'd like to rec today. Here they are: 'A Sadness Runs Through Him' by The Hoosiers, 'Tu Jardín Con Enanitos' by Melendi, Michael Schulte's new song 'Back To The Start' and a whole lot of songs by the Goo Goo Dolls. I've been listening to them lately, and holy crap they're amazing. And their songs fit XiCheng perfectly. Please give 'Sympathy', 'Name', 'Black Balloon' and 'Over and Over' a listen. Especially 'Over and Over'. It's the inspiration for the chapter title and this fic's anthem. At least in my mind. If you don't really feel like looking for all of those things separately, I've made a Spotify playlist for all of them, titled the same as this fic. Creative, right?</p><p>Yesterday, I read the first chapter of this amazing fic by @wolframvonbielefeld (maknaeline), called 'mapmaking'. Holy crap it's SO good. And the premise is fabulous. JC going through tissue rejection of WWX's golden core? So simple and logical, but something I hadn't considered before and it has so much angst potential. I LOVE IT. Please go and read it!</p><p>Thanks for reading guys! Tune in next time :)</p>

    <p>Honestly, working anywhere <em>near</em> another person makes Jiang Cheng’s productivity go to shit. He eyes the stack of finished papers on his side of the desk he’s been sharing with Lan Xichen for the better part of an afternoon. It’s one of two such piles – the other being his <em>unfinished</em> work, which is depressingly the higher of the two.</p><p>He’s always been this way, now that he thinks about it. Which is one of the reasons why he could never get anything done during his own student days at Cloud Recesses – Wei Wuxian was always hovering somewhere nearby, tapping his foot or humming out-of-tune under his breath and generally being noisy and distracting. Jiang Cheng has never done well with distractions.</p><p>Though there’s nothing quite so distracting as watching another sect leader collapse in front of you, then proceed to have a full-blown emotional meltdown (which you instigated, the idiot that you are) and spend the better part of an hour sobbing into your shoulder. Yes; that’s definitely difficult to ignore.</p><p>The faint sound of water splashing into a basin is loud enough to be heard. Said teary sect leader is currently out of the room, shut away in the tiny water closet down the hall and probably washing his face clean of all evidence of the aforementioned emotional breakdown. Which means that Jiang Cheng has been left alone to stare at his mostly-undone paperwork and contemplate his own mistakes.</p><p>This is all his fault, really. For once, absolutely none of the blame can be pinned on anyone else. And for once, Jiang Cheng has absolutely no desire to shift it.</p><p>His heart had nearly fucking <em>stopped</em> when Lan Xichen’s breathing went ragged and gasping. The moment when it halted altogether was one of the most terrifying of Jiang Cheng’s life. It wasn’t even because it was Jiang Cheng’s fault – it was just the sheer, mind-numbing terror of watching the other man get lost somewhere deep inside his own mind. Out of reach. Undoubtedly remembering something from his past and getting sucked into the memory until he couldn’t pull himself back out.</p><p>Panic attacks, Jiang Cheng thinks they’re called. He doesn’t really know, which is ironic and kind of funny because – surprise, surprise – they’re not exactly uncommon for him either. But it’s different when it’s just him; simply another side effect of his shitty life. The memories feel like drowning, yes, but Jiang Cheng was raised by the river and he knows how to hold his breath.</p><p>Watching it happen to Lan Xichen, though, is something else entirely. <em>He</em> isn’t supposed to suffer like that; <em>he</em> shouldn’t have to. <em>He’s</em> never done anything wrong in his fucking life, and the world is a cruel, cruel place because Lan Xichen is <em>good</em> – anyone with eyes can see that – and he doesn’t deserve a godsdamned bit of it.</p><p>Jiang Cheng pushed him to that. Because he couldn’t keep his stupid mouth shut, couldn’t leave well enough alone, and so he pushed and pushed until Lan Xichen fell right over the edge. It’s not the first time, he knows. Jiang Cheng hurts people; it’s what he does. He yells vicious insults and hurls obscenities mixed with barbed truths, lashes flesh with lightning and then pours salt in the wounds. And he doesn’t regret it. Not in the moment, not after, not ever.</p><p>So why did it seem like the world would shatter when he made Lan Xichen cry?</p><p>(He doesn’t think he wants to know the answer to that question.)</p><p>There is the sound of a door opening and the sect leader himself steps back out into the hallway. Every trace of his previous loss of composure has been utterly wiped away; his forehead ribbon is fixed neatly in place, his eyes no longer red and puffy, his cheeks dry. He looks…perfect. Unruffled, like someone who would earn the title ‘Jade’ and actually live up to it. Not at all like someone who’s spent the last half an hour alternating between unintentional self-suffocation and uncontrollable sobbing.</p><p>The younger sect leader’s heart is suddenly beating too fast. He looks away and sobers instantly when his thoughts take a darker turn. Lan Xichen cleans up so well, so quickly. It’s like nothing’s happened at all, and Jiang Cheng wonders if this has gone on before. If Lan Xichen has ever broken down quietly in his room before a Council meeting, has ever had to pick up the pieces of himself on his own, and no one even noticed.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has never noticed anything amiss. Perhaps he should have.</p><p>But it’s not Jiang Cheng’s business to care. He doesn’t know why he does.</p><p>Gods, he’s turning into Nie Huaisang. Doesn’t fucking know anything these days.</p><p>Lan Xichen crosses the room in a few strides, returning to the tiny desk they’ve been sharing. Or at least, they <em>were</em> sharing. He stays standing though, and Jiang Cheng has to look up from where he’s kneeling on the floor, brush in hand. Yards of white cloth fill Jiang Cheng’s vision. Have Zewu-Jun’s shoulders always been that broad?</p><p>It’s not his imagination, because he remembers when he had to borrow the other man’s clothes. Loose in the upper body, bagging slightly around his own shoulders. And he’s seen the way Lan Xichen fights, if not the countless sets of handstands he probably does daily. <em>Definitely</em> not his imagination.</p><p>“I don’t suppose we’ll be getting any more work done today,” the older sect leader says, smiling ruefully. It breaks Jiang Cheng out of his thoughts and he realises he’s been staring.</p><p>Jiang Cheng sets the calligraphy brush down and rearranges the various papers so all their edges align. Then he crosses his arms over his chest. “You’re probably right.”</p><p>They stare at each other awkwardly for a second, neither of them sure what to say next. Lan Xichen folds his arms in an unconscious mimicry of Jiang Cheng’s own pose.</p><p>Even like that, made smaller, Lan Xichen still takes up so much <em>space</em>. For the first time, Jiang Cheng notices how the top of his head almost brushes the rafters that hold up the low ceiling. That he barely took three steps to cross the whole living room, and this is the largest single space in the house. It’s so fucking small, and Jiang Cheng’s been here often enough over the past few days that he’s used to it, but he’s never thought about what it means until now.</p><p>He’s overheard conversations between some of the disciples, about their sect leader and how he hasn’t left this place since he first retreated from the public eye over a year ago. Even though like everything else, there are varying degrees – most cultivators in seclusion still roam relatively freely within the headquarters of their own sects – Lan Xichen seems to have gone immediately for the most extreme option: total isolation.</p><p>He doesn’t half-ass anything, does he?</p><p>And it’s Lan Xichen’s choice if he wants to live like the monk the founder of his sect was, but as Jiang Cheng looks around the living room of the tiny cottage, he finally sees it. Really <em>sees</em> it.</p><p>There’s nothing here; not for anyone who doesn’t wish to spend the rest of their days wasting away in a dead-end corner that barely anyone knows exists. Not for anyone who isn’t waiting for death and halfway there already, and if there’s one thing Jiang Cheng can say about Lan Xichen, it’s that the other man is full of light and life, and no sadness can take that away from him.</p><p>It’s not right. He thinks of spending a year here, staring at the same four rooms, the same neat, brightly-coloured rows of flowers in the garden, the same weed-green surface of the pond outside. Left alone with his thoughts day in and day out, unable to distract himself with conversation, with terrifying the servants, with scolding Jin Ling and watching his every move. Just a visit from his brother maybe three times a week; one from his stern-faced uncle if he’s lucky. It feels like the air is being squeezed out of his lungs.</p><p>Seclusion is bullshit, Jiang Cheng thinks, for what isn’t the first time he’s said it but the first it’s held more than an empty sense of observation. It doesn’t fix anything, doesn’t make anything better – hell, it doesn’t even help with <em>ignoring</em> everything that’s wrong, because the only thing seclusion does is hide problems from everyone else, all the while making sure you never forget they’re there.</p><p>He’s acknowledged Lan Xichen as his friend. Maybe the only friend he’s ever had, and is ever going to. He’ll be damned if he lets him live like this.</p><p>The thought brings with it resolve, a kind of reckless determination that Jiang Cheng hasn’t felt in a long time. He ignores the voice in his head that reminds him that he made Lan Xichen cry less than half an hour ago by pushing too hard, and <em>do you really want to do that again, you absolute idiot?</em> Because yeah, maybe he fucks up everything he touches, but he can’t just sit by and do nothing while his brother-in-law self-immolates in despair, and maybe this is the one thing he can do right.</p><p>“Do you–” Jiang Cheng’s throat is too dry and it comes out like a croak. He tries again. “Do you want to go somewhere?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Feeling rather useless, he waves his hand, gesturing vaguely in the direction of the door. “Outside. Somewhere in the rest of the Cloud Recesses. Somewhere that isn’t here.</p><p>“But…I’m in seclusion.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“What do you mean? I can’t leave here.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng scoffs. “Who said that? There are no rules against cultivators wandering their own sect headquarters. And anyway, you’re the fucking Sect Leader. Who’s going to tell you ‘no’?”</p><p>The other man’s eyes go wide, revealing both his irises in their entirety. Twin golden rings.</p><p>“But that wasn’t the question. I didn’t ask you if you can go anywhere; I asked you if you <em>want</em> to.”</p><p>“I–” Lan Xichen pauses, struggling for words. Jiang Cheng waits for him to continue. He takes a deep breath, but it’s a long time until he lets it out again. “I do.”</p><p>There’s an expression on his face that holds something like longing. Jiang Cheng becomes acutely aware of their difference in position. Lan Xichen standing; him kneeling on the floor letting the other man look down at him, and for <em>fuck’s sake</em> he’s never let anyone look down on him in his life except for Nie Mingjue because that guy had a frankly ridiculous number of inches on him–</p><p>He scrambles to his feet, as dignified as he can make it while simultaneously trying to get upright as fast as possible. Then he’s standing right in front of Lan Xichen and he remembers too late that the older man is <em>still</em> taller than him. For some reason, that doesn’t rankle as much as it should.</p><p>“Well, then. Where would you like to go?”, he asks, trying for gruffness that just isn’t there.</p><p>Lan Xichen considers for a minute. Then, when Jiang Cheng thinks he might not respond at all, he opens his mouth. “The cold springs.”</p><p>Well, that definitely wasn’t the answer he was expecting. “Why?”</p><p>“I miss it. I used to go there sometimes to clear my head. Barely anyone goes there, you know. And I have a lot of good memories of that place. Wangji and I – when we were young, the cold springs were where we learned to swim.”</p><p>“Let’s go, then.” The words are out of Jiang Cheng’s mouth before he can take them back. And he finds he doesn’t want to, because Lan Xichen is looking at him like he’s grown an extra head, but also like that head is really fucking attractive, because there’s surprise on his face but it’s a <em>good</em> kind of surprise. It’s not a look Jiang Cheng’s had directed at him very often. It makes something under his skin glow.</p><p>Lan Xichen smiles, and it feels like a reward in and of itself. “Thank you.”</p><p>That feels like a gift. One Jiang Cheng is probably unworthy of, but he finds he’s too weak to reject it. And he can’t help but smile back.</p>

You probably already know which ones, because I'm not being very subtle, but if you haven't picked up on the correlation between our boys going swimming and JC's issues, that's perfectly okay. I will give you a hint, though - it has to do with what happened to him when he was captured by the Wens. Which probably gives the whole thing away, but there you go.

    <p>It takes longer than expected to get Lan Xichen out of the house. He gets nervous as they’re leaving and nearly chickens out, and there’s a brief moment of panic as Jiang Cheng worries that the other man is going to lose it again. In the end, though, he calms down enough to tell Jiang Cheng what’s bothering him. And gods in heaven, it’s so fucking sad it makes Jiang Cheng’s chest physically ache.</p><p><em>People</em>. That’s all he says, and then he turns his face away and shutters his eyes closed like he thinks Jiang Cheng won’t want to look at him anymore. It’s a single word – basically nonsense – yet Jiang Cheng can read it like it’s a whole book.</p><p>Lan Xichen is afraid to be around people. Perpetually smiling Lan Xichen who is the biggest people-person Jiang Cheng knows, right after Wei Wuxian. It’s another injustice in a line that’s already too damn long.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jiang Cheng somehow manages to convince him that everything’s going to be fine. (He almost applauds himself for that – clearly, he’s better at spouting bullshit than everyone else gives him credit for.) And then the two of them are outside and wandering through the twisting corrdors that lead back to the main complex.</p><p>It’s strange, walking the by-now-familiar path with someone else. He can tell it’s strange for Lan Xichen, too. Having been stuck inside a tiny corner of the place for over a year, he’s looking around at the plain white walls like he’s never seen them before. Like it’s overwhelming for him, suddenly being outside when the only thing standing between it and him for the past twelve months has been his own determination to stay secluded.</p><p>When they come into sight of the main building, the first thing Jiang Cheng notices is that there are people there. Disciples milling around the classroom blocks in Gusu Lan sect robes, one or two boys here and there in the yellow and black of Lanling and Qinghe respectively. Lan Xichen seems to have noticed as well. He freezes, and Jiang Cheng comes to a halt beside him.</p><p>He doesn’t need to turn his head to know that the other man’s back is stiff as a plank, tension etched into every line of his features. A hand slips into his own, clutching at it like a lifeline. Every instinct Jiang Cheng has tells him to let go, to recoil from the unfamiliar touch. Instead, he forces himself to relax.</p><p><em>You talked him into it</em>, he tells himself sternly. After everything that’s happened today, Lan Xichen has more than earned the right to a little human comfort. And if that means that Jiang Cheng has to hold his hand, well then he’s going to suck it up and hold Lan Xichen’s godsdamn hand.</p><p>He returns what he hopes is a reassuring squeeze, and lets Lan Xichen lead him down a path he’s never noticed before. By some miracle, they manage to keep out of sight of the disciples – thank the heavens for that. Jiang Cheng does <em>not</em> want to be one of the poor suckers fattening the rumour mill, especially not with the suspicious way his older brother and the three idiot children have been acting these days. Holding another sect leader’s hand – Wei Wuxian would never let him live it down.</p><p>And if he didn’t already think they were – <em>together</em>, the voice in his mind whispers, sounding smug – then this would do it. Even though he and Lan Xichen are friends. Just friends. Yes. Very much so.</p><p>Friends hold hands all the time, don’t they?</p><p>His stupid, traitorous thoughts keep him sufficiently distracted that he doesn’t even notice that they’ve reached the woods that border the cold springs until Lan Xichen ducks under a branch that he fails to register and it hits him in the face. He gets a mouthful of leaves for his trouble and the other man, who is by now standing on the other side of the tree, covers the lower half of his face to hide what is undoubtedly a smirk.</p><p>Jiang Cheng whacks the branch out of the way irritably, stepping past and rejoining him while his other hand rubs at his mouth.</p><p>“Smug bastard,” he mutters under his breath. Surprisingly, his temper doesn’t flare at the choked-off laugh that is Lan Xichen’s reaction.</p><p>They’re no longer holding hands, he notices too late. <em>Dumbass</em>. Of course they’d let go once the kids were out of sight and the older man’s nerves could settle. He clenches his fingers into a fist.</p><p>“Have you ever come here before?”, asks Lan Xichen. The snort that escapes Jiang Cheng can hardly be helped.</p><p>“I was here the other day. With Jin Ling and Lan Sizhui.”</p><p>The other sect leader’s smile grows wider. “Oh, yes. How could I forget?”</p><p>“That’s right – how could you? You’re a terrible friend.”</p><p>Lan Xichen slides Jiang Cheng a mischievous grin. “I suppose I’ll just have to make it up to you, then.”</p><p>“What–” Jiang Cheng nearly trips over a rock and spends a moment regaining his balance. All the blood in his body flows into his face at once. “What the fuck does that mean?”</p><p>“Nothing,” he says innocently, grin turning instantly guileless. Jiang Cheng’s eyes narrow, but he lets it drop.</p><p>Another half a minute of walking, and the leafy greenery opens up onto a small rock pool. It looks different in the daytime. Less unearthly than it was the only other time Jiang Cheng’s ever been here, more grounded in reality. The afternoon sun shimmers across the surface of the water, and it’s clear all the way down to the shallow bottom.</p><p>It looks…it honestly does look rather like a swimming hole, the kind a young Lan Xichen might have gone to with his brother. Spent hours there playing in the water, heedless of how freezing it probably is, given that it’s called the ‘cold springs’ and all. Jiang Cheng glances over at his companion, whose face is turned up to the sky like he’s soaking in the sunlight. Which doesn’t make a lot of sense if Jiang Cheng thinks about it, because the cottage gets just as much sun as the rest of Cloud Recesses.</p><p>Perhaps it’s just the way things are in Lan Xichen’s head. Maybe everything about the outside feels just that much better when you haven’t seen it in a year. Absence makes the heart grow fonder and shit.</p><p>So Jiang Cheng just stands there while the older man takes in his first view of the world outside his cottage for the first time in months. It’s awkward, but well, this is his place; they’re here for him.</p><p>He honestly expects Lan Xichen to sit down or something, maybe pull his boots off so he can dip his toes in the water or something sappy and normal like that. But that’s not what he does. Instead, his hands go to the ties on his robes.</p><p>He <em>pulls</em>, and his belt comes loose and falls to the ground. Then he peels himself out of his outer layer of clothing, leaving him in only the fitted white inner robe–</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s poor brain sputters like a guttering flame and promptly dies on him. The Lan sect leader is honest-to-gods <em>stripping</em> in front of him like there’s absolutely nothing wrong with this, shedding his fucking <em>clothes</em> all while the serene smile on his face never falters.</p><p>His voice briefly deserts him and he’s left gaping like a fish as Lan Xichen’s long fingers reach for the ties on his inner robes. Jiang Cheng suddenly rediscovers his ability to speak.</p><p>“The hell are you doing?”</p><p>The question sounds shrill, uncharacteristically high-pitched, and Jiang Cheng feels his face flame red. Lan Xichen just turns those amber eyes on him and says calmly, “I’m going swimming.”</p><p>His fingers pinch the string and tug; the knot unravels and then he shrugs the garment off his shoulders. It falls in a heap at his feet, joining the rest of his outfit and Lan Xichen is suddenly divested of his last layer of clothing, standing bare to the waist in the afternoon sunlight. Only a thin pair of white linen trousers still cover his – um, <em>modesty</em>.</p><p>At this point, though, Jiang Cheng is seriously wondering whether Zewu-Jun has any of that left.</p><p>Lan Xichen kneels down to fold his robes, then stands up again and makes his way over to the water’s edge. He slips in, making barely a sound as the clear water slides over toned muscles and unblemished skin like white jade, even though it has to be cold as fuck. Droplets cling to his shoulders and arms and his entire upper body is on display, yet he stretches out unself-consciously and <em>holy fuck why can’t Jiang Cheng look away?</em></p><p>He stands rooted to the spot as the older man removes the pins from his hair and sets them neatly on the perfectly-folded squares of clothing. Lan Xichen cocks his head and fixes Jiang Cheng with a stare.</p><p>“Aren’t you coming?”, he asks in that same guileless tone. <em>Oh, no</em>.</p><p>The bottom drops out of Jiang Cheng’s stomach. Shivery cold begins to creep up his spine.</p><p>He hadn’t considered this, when he’d brought up leaving the cottage and agreed to Lan Xichen’s suggestion of the cold springs. He hadn’t thought it might include–</p><p>
  <em>Stupid. You fucking idiot.</em>
</p><p>His fingers itch for Zidian. He can’t. Not this. Something thick and heavy settles in his chest, right below his heart where <em>it</em> is and <em>no, no, no he can’t show it to anyone he can’t let anyone see.</em></p><p>“No,” he says curtly. Guilt adds itself to the dark emotions swirling in his gut at the way Lan Xichen’s smile dims. But he can’t do this, not even if it makes him feel like a complete and utter bastard for dragging Lan Xichen out of his house and then leaving him hanging. He just can’t.</p><p>The other man tries again. “I thought people from Yunmeng were amazing swimmers.” His tone is light and teasing, but it makes something in Jiang Cheng’s throat shrivel up and die.</p><p>“I can swim,” he snaps back, and hates himself a little when his sharp tone makes the other man flinch. “I’m just not going to.”</p><p>Why does everything always blow up in his face? Why can’t he be <em>normal</em> for once, just do something nice for another person and not hurt them when it invariably pokes at things he’d rather ignore? He’d been doing so well, too – had almost managed to forget it was there (because he’ll never truly be able to forget it, but he could do <em>almost</em>). Why is he so…so–</p><p>“Are you all right?” Lan Xichen’s voice is gentle. Jiang Cheng would rather it be grating. He’d rather it spark hate in him, instead of the all-too-familiar feeling of letting someone down. This was supposed to be about <em>Lan Xichen</em>, not him.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“Are you sure? Is there something wrong? Was it something I said? I’m sorry.”</p><p><em>Oh, there it is</em>. The anger finally resurfaces, and Jiang Cheng grabs onto it with both hands, uncaring that it’s at himself.</p><p>“No. I’m fine,” he says again. “I’m coming.”</p><p>He clenches his teeth so hard they hurt. Then he turns his back on the other sect leader. Loosens the ties on his robes and tugs them off in short, jerky movements.</p><p><em>You’re a coward</em>, the voice in his mind tells him. He wishes it would shut up.</p><p><em>You’re disgusting, and now he’s going to see how worthless you really are</em>.</p><p>
  <em>Didn’t you swear to yourself that you’d never let anyone see? Pathetic.</em>
</p><p>He doesn’t have a clue what he’s doing, but the voice spurs him on. He wants so badly to prove it wrong, but how can he? Nothing’s ever gone right for him before. Why would it this time?</p><p>Now he’s just as bare as Lan Xichen, covered only by a pair of black pants from the waist down. He can feel the other man’s eyes on his back, concerned and soft, and he wishes he could pause this moment right before everything goes to shit. Wishes he didn’t have to turn around, but he does because he’s backed himself into a corner that he can’t get out of, and he knows it’s his own fault but that won’t stop him from wishing it never happened.</p><p>He drags it out. Of course he does. He’s a coward, after all.</p><p>His fingers tremble as he removes the pins in his hair that keep it up. Trying to steady his hands only makes the shaking worse, so he bears it as he finally undoes the violet ribbon and his hair falls loose down his back, onto his shoulders, over his chest.</p><p>And then he turns around.</p>

          <p>Hey everybody! Wow, my second update in as many days!!!! (Wow, way too many exclamation marks!!!) I'm back. </p><p>Y'all probably figured this out already, but in case it was unclear, the issue here is JC's scar. Yes, the big honking one on his chest that Wen Chao gave him with the Jiang sect's discipline whip. I figure it's probably caused him a lot of pain both in the past and recently, so in the next chapter, this fic is going to have a new tag. I'm going to give some advance warning here in case it's triggering at all. I don't want anyone to get hurt by this story, because fanfic is for fun. Please look after your mental health guys :) So, yeah; the next chapter deals with a bit of implied/referenced self-harm. Perhaps not in the way you might think, but it's there all the same.<br/>Again, as always, please inform me if I have dealt with it insensitively so I can fix it.</p><p>Today's song is 'Stigmatised' by The Calling. Also, 'One by One' is my favourite song by them, and I think it fits pretty well.</p><p>See you next time, and have a great day :)</p>

    <p>Lan Huan knows something’s wrong the first time Jiang Wanyin says ‘no’. It’s in his voice – a hollow quaver that he doesn’t think the man himself even notices. Then the younger sect leader snaps at him and his suspicions are confirmed.</p><p>It’s puzzling, to say the least. Mere minutes ago, everything was fine. They’d been teasing each other. Jiang Wanyin had <em>laughed</em>. Now something has changed. Everything is decidedly not fine, and Lan Huan can’t figure out out why.</p><p>More than anything, it’s worrying.</p><p>Lan Huan has just come back out into the world for the first time in over a year after getting pulled out of a panic attack. He’s still shaky and emotional, and not yet in a good enough place mentally to comfort himself. Much less someone else. If the other man breaks down, he’s not sure what he’s going to do. He still doesn’t trust himself not to start crying again.</p><p>But Jiang Wanyin says “I’m coming” and puts his back to him, and suddenly his robes are slipping off his shoulders. Lan Huan’s eyes can’t help but follow the curve of his back, the sharp lines of his hips revealed to the afternoon sunlight. His skin is smooth, slightly darker than Lan Huan’s from the warmer climate of Yunmeng, and Lan Huan’s throat constricts as he swallows.</p><p>His own skin feels very hot and very tight, and for once, he doesn’t notice the freezing temperatures of the cold springs.</p><p>There’s no time to dwell on it, however. Jiang Wanyin turns around to face him and–</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>
  <em>No wonder he didn’t want to.</em>
</p><p>The Yunmeng Jiang sect leader’s chest looks as though it was split open by a bolt of lightning and sewn back together again. A thick, ropy scar runs diagonally from just below his right shoulder to a little left of his navel, ridged and familiar. Yes, Lan Huan has seen it before: thirty-three times on his little brother’s back. The unmistakable brand of a discipline whip, meant to mark forever.</p><p>Then Lan Huan looks closer, unable to help himself, and his breath catches in his throat. The rest of Jiang Wanyin’s chest is a mess of scar tissue, a network of raised, white ridges zig-zagging over the larger one that bisects the man’s torso. Almost as though drowning it out. Or covering it up.</p><p>But somehow, the whip scar still shines through, the first thing Lan Huan sees, even past the dense silver lines. Lines too precise and perfectly straight to have been made with anything other than a blade. The water feels cold again.</p><p>
  <em>What happened to you?</em>
</p><p>Whatever Lan Huan was expecting, it wasn’t this.</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Lan Xichen’s gasp rings loud in the quiet. Jiang Cheng doesn’t have to look to see his expression – he already knows what he’ll find. Disgust. Horror. Everything he sees every time he looks in the fucking mirror. Pity, perhaps. If he’s lucky.</p><p>Cold settles in the pit of his stomach, bottomless and fathomless. It’s lead-heavy, dragging at his bones. He knows what he looks like, knows his torso resembles one of the practice dummies they let advanced disciples whale on once they get good enough at their sword forms.</p><p>It’s his own fault, he thinks, tasting bitterness in his mouth.</p><p>Jiang Cheng lowers himself into the water and takes a place at the far side of the pool. Gooseflesh breaks out across his skin, but he ignores it. What’s the point? He’s already so fucking cold.</p><p>He doesn’t even look at Lan Xichen once. Just keeps his head ducked, staring at the water’s surface, at the ripples that form from the rise and fall of his chest. His scarred, disfigured chest.</p><p>Nobody’s ever seen; nobody even knows. He’s never allowed them to. What could he say? Would he give voice to the shame that’s settled in his marrow for nearly two decades, that lives in his heart and has now sunk roots into every part of him since he was seventeen? The shame that he is?</p><p>Not fucking likely. A hysterical laugh bubbles in his chest. Oh yes, he’s made of weakness, but he can’t show anything but strength to anyone else. Can’t let them see, he thinks mockingly, even though everyone around him has always been able to see right through him. They’ve always known exactly what he’s worth, even when he couldn’t see it himself.</p><p><em>See? I’m always right</em>, the voice in his head says smugly. The weight of Lan Xichen’s gaze rests heavy on his back, his face, anywhere but his chest, and suddenly Jiang Cheng can’t take it anymore.</p><p>“Just go on and fucking stare, all right? We both know that’s what you want. Please; don’t constrain yourself on my account.” He spits the words like acid, but they sound pathetic even to his own ears.</p><p>“Wanyin–”</p><p>Gods, even with just two words, Lan Xichen’s concern is audible. His tone is comforting. Reassuring. It just makes Jiang Cheng angrier. He doesn’t need (<em>deserve</em>) to be handled with kid gloves, to be treated like something soft and breakable. Like a small forest animal that will run if it hears a raised voice.</p><p>As if on cue, the voice returns, slithering through his mind. It’s nasally, higher than normal, and Jiang Cheng’s brain whites out at the very sound of it.</p><p><em>You stupid, worthless brat</em>. He’d know that voice anywhere. It’s seventeen years gone, but it’s long since been inked into his memories. Bled into his dreams, where he can never forget it. Never stop hearing it.</p><p><em>What a fucking disappointment. I would pity you. But it would hardly be worth the effort</em>.</p><p>Every muscle in his body tenses, because he knows what comes next. Pain sparking white-hot; every bruise, every cut an agony without the golden core in his chest that was his last defense. And he is hollow inside, the absence an empty space. It is meant to break him but it only makes him angry – angry enough to fill up that space with rage and hatred and vows of vengeance that are hard to keep up when he is pinned to the freezing stone floor, the ropes around his wrists tight enough that his fingers go numb.</p><p>All the while that nasally voice keeps on fucking monologuing, and he regains just enough awareness to think that <em>huh, he sounds like one of the villains in Wei Wuxian’s novels</em>. Right before the voice starts again, insults dripping like poison. He wants to ignore them, but they’re everywhere, seeping into his eyes and ears until nothing else exists.</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” he forces out through gritted teeth. His hands are over his ears – when did that happen? – like he can block out the voice if he just presses hard enough, but it’s inside his head. It’s inside him.</p><p>
  <em>Guess you really are as stupid as they say, hmm? Couldn’t leave well enough alone, could you? Couldn’t get it into your head that you’re not strong enough to fight back. You’re not even strong enough not to scream.</em>
</p><p>Everything is dark. Jiang Cheng realises he’s closing his eyes, squeezing them shut so tightly that he can’t see any light at all.</p><p><em>No wonder even your own father didn’t want you</em>.</p><p>There’s a touch on his shoulder, soft and fleeting. He forgets where he is; doesn’t think, just reacts. Then Zidian is no longer a ring, but solid in his hand and he can feel the power thrumming through it. He lashes out – once, twice – wanting to hurt, to fight back, to make the fucking <em>dog</em> on the other end feel as much pain as he’s dealt out.</p><p>None of his blows connect, his limbs moving sluggishly through – is that <em>water?</em> – and it brings him out of his trance. Light streams through his now-open eyelids. His face is contorted into a snarl, an expression he’s sure makes him look half feral. He’s standing waist-deep in the fucking cold springs of all things, in the Cloud Recesses.</p><p>And, standing right opposite him, breathing hard, arms raised in a defensive pose, is Lan Xichen. The leader of the Gusu Lan sect. The man he thinks might be his best friend. The man he’s just attacked.</p><p>His gut twists. It’s all the warning he gets before he’s vaulted out of the water and finds himself bent double on the grass beside the pool, retching. His stomach spasms again and again, but nothing comes up.</p><p>He wants to crawl out of his skin. To find a new body maybe, one that is faster and stronger and <em>better</em>, so he can leave behind everything that ties him to his old one. So he can pretend, even for a little while, that he could be someone else.</p><p>Even after the dry heaves stop, shudders continue to wrack his body. He’s shaking so hard he barely even notices when someone comes up behind him. A hand hovers over his shoulder again, but hesitant this time. Wary. When it finally comes to rest on his bare skin, he shivers again. His face is wet, he realises. Jiang Cheng swipes at his eyes angrily, even as his abdominal muscles ache from the hell he’s just put them through.</p><p>“Wanyin?”</p><p>His name is a question, the tone the same as before, laced with worry and a new hint of cautiousness. Jiang Cheng has never hated himself more than he does in this moment.</p><p>The other man shifts so that he’s standing in front of him, hand still on his shoulder as he lowers himself to his knees. It’s all Jiang Cheng can do to gasp out a litany of “I’m sorry”s, throat burning and chest feeling as though it’s been wrapped with iron bands and <em>squeezed</em>. Is this how it feels to beWei Wuxian? If so, he needs to apologise to his brother.</p><p>“It’s all right. It’s all right.” Lan Xichen sounds like he’s shushing a bawling infant – ordinarily, the comparison would be insulting enough to send Jiang Cheng into a state approaching murderous rage. But something inside of him has been rubbed raw and bleeding, and he clings to the offered comfort like a drowning man thrown a life raft.</p><p>Lan Xichen pulls him into a hug. Jiang Cheng falls forward ungracefully, slumping against the other man, their arms thrown around each other’s shoulders. Chests pressed so close together that Jiang Cheng can feel the other man’s heartbeat, his smooth skin. He wonders if his own feels like a woodcut, or something worse.</p><p>Eventually, the shaking subsides. Jiang Cheng pulls back, and so does Lan Xichen, who holds on just a half-second longer than necessary. They’re sat back on their ankles just like in the cottage barely half an hour ago, yet Jiang Cheng feels so wrung-out, like a washtowel hung out to dry. Both their pants are wet – it’s uncomfortable to say the least, but neither moves.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he says again, mouth dry. “I didn’t mean– I shouldn’t have attacked you. I didn’t know–”</p><p>“Please don’t say sorry.” A ghost of a smile curves the older sect leader’s mouth. His words are strangely reminiscent of the ones Jiang Cheng used to scold him, back in the cottage earlier today. “It’s not your fault.”</p><p>
  <em>Things really do come full circle.</em>
</p><p>“You were…somewhere else. Weren’t you? The way I was?”</p><p>
  <em>I don’t want to talk about it.</em>
</p><p>But Lan Xichen isn’t demanding anything, isn’t asking Jiang Cheng to spill his pathetic life story. He’s just <em>there</em>. He puts his hand on his shoulder and hugs him as though Jiang Cheng didn’t fucking come at him with Zidian not three minutes before, and his voice is full of something soft and sad that isn’t pity. It isn’t sympathy either, and Jiang Cheng is simultaneously distrustful and in awe of it. He wants to know what it is, what it feels like. To understand.</p><p>And anyway, he owes him.</p><p>He lets out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding. “Yes. I was.”</p>

    <p>He can still hear Wen Chao’s voice taunting him. It’s that more than anything else that pulls the words out of him, in an effort to drown it out.</p><p>“I was seventeen,” he begins. “Got myself captured by Wen Chao and his merry band of douchebags. It’s not important how. But I– it was right after the siege at Lotus Pier. I was half out of my mind.”</p><p><em>The siege at Lotus Pier</em>. Pretty words, cool and detached. It sounds better than <em>the night they burned my fucking home to the ground and slaughtered everyone I knew</em>. Jiang Cheng thinks maybe part of him died that night along with his parents, a little sliver of his soul scraped away with every body that he saw in that courtyard.</p><p>He couldn’t count them all.</p><p>“They took me then.” He lets out a bitter laugh. “There weren’t even that many of them. We were on the run; Wei Wuxian wasn’t around and I couldn’t fight them off on my own. Some cultivator that makes me.”</p><p>Lan Xichen blinks. “You were only seventeen,” he says, like that makes a damn bit of difference. Like it mattered when those dogs loosed themselves on him like a pack of wolves, slashing and tearing at a stupid, stupid <em>boy</em> too weak to fight back. Who’d never stood a chance in the first place.</p><p>Wei Wuxian might have, he thinks. But then the whole point of it all was to make sure his older brother never had to find that out.</p><p>
  <em>Send in the weaker prey, the one more easily captured. So the strong might slip past to fight another day.</em>
</p><p>He laughs again. “Didn’t mean anything to them, did it?” <em>I should have been stronger. I should have–</em> “They dragged me back to Lotus Pier anyway. Or what was left of it. There wasn’t much of anything, just ashes.”</p><p>The other man’s grip on his shoulder tightens until it’s almost painful. The pressure is grounding. It keeps Jiang Cheng from slipping away again, and he welcomes it. Lan Xichen must be thinking of his own home. How the proud, isolated Cloud Recesses too had fallen to the Wens, the scum of the earth, and how the young heir to the sect was forced to run until it was nothing but smoke in the distance.</p><p>Both of them had had to. Jiang Cheng was just the one who got caught.</p><p>Everything suddenly appears before him, clear as the day it happened.</p><p>
  <em>His hands were bound, his mouth gagged, a guard on each side hauling him along the corridors of the husk that was once his home. Scorch marks littered grey stone walls, wood ones burned away entirely. Bloodstains on the floor where the surface was scuffed from a fight. Someone’s severed hand.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He made himself look, took in all the destruction the Wen-dogs had wrought upon his home, breathed in the stench of decaying flesh and burnt remains, of bodily fluids and fear. Then they threw him in the armory.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It was empty; they’d taken every weapon the Jiang sect owned and distributed them among their own men. His family’s steel, in the hands of this filth. It made his stomach turn.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>No. The room wasn’t quite empty. There was someone waiting for him. Wen Chao. His harpy of a mistress nowhere to be seen; thank the gods for small mercies. But his lips were peeled back in a smirk, the same kind he’d worn when he kicked the body of Jiang Cheng’s mother in the head. He didn’t look like he was going to be merciful.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The two guards untied the rope that bound his hands together and shackled him to the floor, his limbs splayed out. Then they retreated from the room and Wen Chao called in Wen Zhuliu. Wen Ruohan’s faithful pet cultivator. The man who’d killed Jiang Cheng’s Ah-Niang.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>His vision blazed with hate. He struggled against the restraints, screaming obscenities through the gag. Wen Chao just laughed. Wen Zhuliu didn’t even react.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Finally some spirit,” Wen Chao exclaimed. His voice was just as weaselly as the rest of him. “You know, I almost didn’t remember who you were. So…obedient, so quiet. Such a good little hostage, always did what you were told. I was beginning to think you were as spineless as your father.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>That bastard. Jiang Cheng renewed his struggling, chains clanking, pulled taut by the force of his pulling. But they held firm, and Wen Chao stepped closer. Took hold of his face, fingers digging harshly into his jaw.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“That’s hardly the way to treat your betters. I’m disappointed. I thought your mother had taught you better.” His grin spread across his face. “Well, I’ll just have to teach you some manners.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He released Jiang Cheng’s face. Jiang Cheng could already feel the bruises beginning to form where his hand had gripped him. Wen Chao moved back. Turned to Wen Zhuliu.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You know what to do.” Almost as an afterthought, he waved his hand. “Oh, and remove the gag. I want to hear him scream.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Then Wen Zhuliu’s hand reached inside his chest, and the pain began.</em>
</p><p>The memory ends. Jiang Cheng’s still talking. He didn’t even notice before, but the words are spilling out of his mouth and suddenly he can’t stop them. And there’s more, so much more.</p><p>“He took my golden core. You already know that part. Hell, the whole fucking world knows it. It’s not like it’s a secret.” He pauses, swallows a few times to rid his mouth of the taste of bile. Lan Xichen, who hasn’t said a word this whole time, shifts slightly. “But after that, well.”</p><p>“Wen Chao did what he liked with me. Said I was his– his <em>property</em>. Like some sort of toy. He liked the power trip, the sick fuck. Liked having a sect heir under his thumb, to do what he pleased with. Even gave his bitch girlfriend a turn. She saw it as <em>compensation</em>–” he spits the word – “for the whipping my mother gave her.”</p><p>The other man’s expression is horrified, growing more so with every word Jiang Cheng speaks.</p><p>“He let her watch,” he says, suprisingly steady even though he feels like he might explode, “when he did this.”</p><p>He doesn’t even need to say what <em>this</em> is. Of their own accord, Lan Xichen’s gaze drifts downwards towards the scar. The big one on his chest; his greatest shame made flesh. The older sect leader’s eyes are soft and sad, and Jiang Cheng has the inexplicable urge to rip the emotion from him. To strip the gentleness away and replace it with something jagged and ugly. Something that hurts. He doesn’t understand. Why does he want so badly to be hated?</p><p>(He doesn’t. Not really. But he more than deserves it.)</p><p>“It’s fucking pathetic, don’t you think?” His words are hard and cruel, directed at himself. They sink into his skin like they belong. “He only used the discipline whip once. <em>Once</em>, and I screamed so loud they heard me in the courtyard. I cried, you know, like a baby. Yelled for my parents.” He shakes his head. “Pathetic,” he repeats.</p><p>“They couldn’t save me. <em>I </em>couldn’t save myself. I was too weak to keep <em>Wen Chao</em> from branding me like I was a fucking cow.”</p><p>“You weren’t weak. You aren’t now, either.” Lan Xichen interrupts Jiang Cheng’s tirade for the first time in what feels like forever. There is steel in his expression under the softness; it screams <em>shut up and listen</em>. Jiang Cheng falls silent. “You were just a child, you were grieving, and there were more of them than you. There is no shame in losing to that. Nor in being captured.”</p><p>His head is spinning. It’s never occurred to him not to be ashamed of the scar on his chest, of the lash that marks him as property of a Wen. Maybe the worst Wen of them all. But – no, Lan Xichen can’t be telling the truth. He’s wrong.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s own little brother had borne thirty-three of these scars voluntarily, dealt to him by his clan elders. But that was different. Hanguang-Jun’s scars came from <em>courage</em>. From fighting to protect the man he loved against everything, even the people he was supposed to answer to. There is only honour in something like that. His scars are battle scars, marks of his devotion.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s just signifies his own worthlessness. If a Wen is scum, lower than dirt, what does that make him?</p><p>He hates Wen Chao, Wen Zhuliu, every last member of that accursed family. For doing this to him, for stripping him down to nothing and grinding him beneath their heels. For taking away his home, his family. For making him less than nothing. A dog, to the dogs of the earth.</p><p>Lan Xichen can’t even see. He is too pure, and it makes him blind.</p><p>“There is nothing <em>but</em> shame,” says Jiang Cheng honestly. He gestures to his chest. To the smaller scars that lace over the largest one. “These? I did these to myself, out of the shame you say doesn’t exist.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“It does to you. Otherwise you wouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>Wouldn’t he? Of all the things Jiang Cheng’s done to himself, this– he isn’t ashamed of this. But no one else would understand. They’d look at him with pity, the braver ones with disgust.</p><p>
  <em>How could you carve yourself up like this?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>You must be so lonely, if your only solace is in pain.</em>
</p><p>But the pain wasn’t the point. It never had been. They wouldn’t understand. <em>They’d</em> never been marked like livestock, with a whip instead of a knife that hurt even more and somehow cut even deeper.</p><p>“Please,” Lan Xichen says, voice whisper-soft. It sounds like a prayer. “I want to understand.”</p><p>And by the ten palaces of hell, Jiang Cheng can’t refuse him. “You know discipline whip mark scars can’t be removed. They remain forever on the body of the punished.”</p><p>The other man nods.</p><p>“Well, I tried. I tried <em>everything</em> to get rid of this. The first few years, it was the ordinary treatments: oils, ointments, salves. Nothing worked. Then–” his breath hitches – “then one night, I’d had a little too much to drink, and I realised that there was one thing I hadn’t tried. I used a spiritual knife, the kind I knew would leave a mark if I…cut deep enough. And I tried to cover up the scar.”</p><p>He forces his lips to twist into a smile. It probably looks more like a grimace. “As you can see, that didn’t do anything either. It just turned me into even more of a wreck.”</p><p>“I hate them; I do. Not because they’re shameful. Because they didn’t <em>work</em>. I thought that if I could drown it out, at least the scars would be my own. But instead I lost to Wen Chao again, and I still have to see it every time I look in the mirror.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng is breathing hard now, the truths that have been forced out of him leaving him shaking like a house ripped through by a tidal wave. His fists are clenched tight, knuckles white and nails digging into his palms. It stings. He clenches them tighter.</p><p>Then another pair of hands is on his. Lan Xichen’s noticed. Of <em>course</em>. Slender, callused fingers curl around his right, prying open his hand. A thumb that isn’t his ghosts over his palm, back and forth across the angry red crescents his nails have left in the flesh. The older man moves on to his other hand, repeating the process.</p><p>“Hey, listen to me, all right?” Everything about Lan Xichen right now is soothing. Despite himself, Jiang Cheng can’t help but comply. “That’s it,” he says as Jiang Cheng’s hands relax.</p><p>“You don’t have anything to be ashamed of. Not your scars, not your losses.”</p><p>“But they’re <em>disgusting</em>.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng is taken aback by his own raw honesty. But Lan Xichen shakes his head. “Nothing about you is disgusting. It’s not wrong to hate what was done to you. But you shouldn’t let it twist you into hating yourself. You were a <em>child</em>. There’s nothing wrong with being afraid.”</p><p>“But I’m still afraid!”</p><p>Jiang Cheng nearly claps a hand over his mouth. He hadn’t meant to say that. He’s never even thought it. But he didn’t know until it came flying out of his mouth, how true that statement is.</p><p>“I’m still afraid,” he whispers again. “It’s been so long, and he’s dead – they’re all dead; I killed them all – but I’m still so scared. He made me know what it’s like to have nothing, to be nothing, and I haven’t been able to forget that. I can’t. And I’m terrified it’s going to happen again. No matter how old I get, or how powerful, how far away it all seems, I’m always afraid.”</p><p>He looks up and meets the other sect leader’s gaze. Lan Xichen’s expression melts, sadness painting every angle of his face. Not because of him; for him. His eyes go a little glassy. “<em>Fuck</em>, Wanyin.”</p><p>The way Lan Xichen says his name, low and filled with emotion, does something to Jiang Cheng’s insides that is completely at odds with how raw he feels.</p><p>“You’re– you’re not nothing,” he says fiercely. “You’ve never been nothing. You’re strong and you’re a fighter; you don’t run away from your problems, you face them head-on. I’ve seen it. You see things that are impossible, and do them anyway.”</p><p>The Yunmeng Jiang sect motto. Jiang Cheng blinks, and a tear rolls down his cheek. <em>Know it is impossible, and do it anyway.</em> Not just attempt the impossible, but conquer it. His father said once that Jiang Cheng didn’t live up to the words. Wasn’t the embodiment of them, the way a sect leader should be.</p><p>“I don’t know how you– how <em>anyone</em> could go through something like that and do the things you’ve done. You rebuilt your sect from nothing, with no one to help you. You raised your nephew like he was your own child; it’s obvious every time you talk about him how proud you are of the man he is. He’s going to be a great sect leader, and you helped him get there.”</p><p>Lan Xichen stares him straight in the face. His eyes are the brightest gold Jiang Cheng has ever seen.</p><p>“The past may have been horrible, but it’s in the past. You don’t belong to it, or to Wen Chao, or to anyone but yourself. You don’t have to be afraid anymore.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng lets go, and cries. Of fucking course he does.</p>

          <p>It's finally done! Wooooooo!!!!</p><p>So, the breakdown of what happens here: JC spills the story of how he got his scars. The big one - discipline whip by WC - and the multitude of smaller ones - drunken and ineffectual attempt to cover up the discipline whip mark by creating new scars over it. (He still hasn't said anything about how he was captured to keep WWX safe, don't worry that's for another chapter.) JC then confesses that he's still afraid - of WC specifically - even though all the Wens are long dead (discounting LSZ), because they showed him what it was like to be nothing and he can't forget that lesson. Long story short, LXC ends up comforting him and telling him that the past is in the past, and he doesn't have to be afraid anymore. JC breaks down and cries.</p><p>And there you have it folks! I really hope this didn't come across as too out-of-character (maybe a little, though, but that's okay), and that you enjoyed it. Yesterday's chapter didn't have any author's notes because I was really tired for some reason and fell asleep right after posting. Thanks for sticking with this story, everybody. Your support means a lot.</p><p>Today's song recommendation is 'How To Save A Life' by the Fray. I thought it was appropriate, given the theme of this chapter. Also, I read the first chapter (~13000 words) of a fantastic XiCheng fanfic today. It's called 'Upon Our Silver Bridge' by @TheWanderingHeart, and it's so good. I laughed, I cried, I left kudos and bookmarked. I really hope the author continues this wonderful piece of writing. It's canon continuation with wonderful characterisation, and everything you could want from a XiCheng fic. Please go and check it out if you have the time.</p><p>Thank you, and goodbye!</p>

    <p> “Why weren’t we friends, before?”, Jiang Wanyin asks later, when the redness has more or less retreated from his eyes.</p><p>By some unspoken agreement, they haven’t gone back in the water. Neither have they bothered to put their robes back on; it’s one of the first warm days of the spring, and both of them are taking advantage of it, lying half-clothed across the grass that borders the springs, soaking up the golden sunlight. It’s rather unseemly, Lan Huan reflects, for two sect leaders to be sprawled on the dirt in such an undignified manner, side-by-side with shoulders almost touching, but this is the position that requires the least energy. And honestly, it has been a very trying day.</p><p>Lan Huan turns his head to look at the other man. His eyes are closed, chin tipped back to face the sky. It’s almost as if he’d never spoken. But Lan Huan knows he didn’t imagine the question.</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘before’?” He rolls the word on his tongue. Lan Huan is not unintelligent; he already knows the answer. He just wants to hear Jiang Wanyin say it out loud.</p><p>The younger sect leader’s eyes open, lashes fluttering, and he turns over on his side to face Lan Huan properly. Lying here, all Lan Huan can see is blue, deep as the water on the far side of the lake that lies outside Caiyi Village.</p><p>“Everything. Before the Sunshot Campaign. Before the fires. When I was– when <em>Wei Wuxian and I</em> were studying here.” Jiang Wanyin’s bottom lip finds its way between his teeth. He worries at it, the flesh going white beneath the pressure.</p><p>It’s oddly endearing. And unfamiliar.</p><p>But– <em>no</em>, Lan Huan realises, a strange feeling shooting through his stomach. It’s not. He’s seen that absent, nervous gesture before. On a teenager, long-limbed and gangly, face still the soft, rounded edges of adolescence rather than an adult’s sharp edges; not yet quite grown into himself. Quiet and reserved, always following behind someone else – his father at the yearly sect meetings, and later at school, his older brother. Lan Huan hadn’t known he remembered that. Or even that he’d known it in the first place.</p><p>Then he realises that he’s staring, and the rhythm of his heart feels alien in his chest. A little harder than usual. A little too quick.</p><p>“Well,” he attempts to say through the sudden dryness in his mouth, “there was the fact that you were a few years too young for me.”</p><p>The laugh that comes from the other man has clearly been startled out of him, but it makes Lan Huan’s insides go warm all the same.</p><p>“Asshole,” Jiang Wanyin says, the barest trace of affection in his voice. Then he takes a breath, and when he lets it out again, he sounds more serious. “After that, then; when there was peace, more or less. The thirteen years my brother was gone. Why weren’t we–” he seems to struggle with the word – “why were we never close?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>But that’s not quite true, is it? There’s a multitude of reasons for it, just like there were so many reasons for his friendship with Nie Mingjue, with Jin Guang– with <em>him</em>. The thought hurts his heart as it rises, unbidden, but he lets it come. There’s no one answer he can give, no one thing he can point to and say <em>that’s why he cared about me</em>, or <em>that’s why I loved him</em>. There’s no <em>that’s why we never mattered to each other</em>.</p><p>There are so many, but he goes with one he thinks might make sense out loud. And not just in his own head.</p><p>“I think,” he tries again, “maybe we were just different. Or we started out different, and didn’t reach a point where that mattered less than trying to know each other.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin doesn’t ask <em>different how?</em> and so Lan Huan doesn’t have to explain.</p><p>“What changed, then?”, is what he does ask. “I’m still from Yunmeng, and you’re still from Gusu. I’m still your younger brother’s age, and you’re still the leader of a sect that’s more like a monastery than a clan of cultivators. We’re no less different than we were before.”</p><p><em>He thinks we’re friends now</em>, the little voice in his head comments. For once, it doesn’t sound snarky or sarcastic or cutting. Funny, how the only person it ever quiets down for is Jiang Wanyin, a man renowned for his vicious tongue and fiery temper.</p><p>There’s a realisation there, but it hangs just out of reach. Like a jar on the highest cupboard shelf, or a word read years ago in a book long since forgotten.</p><p>Lan Huan looks at the man beside him. Allows himself to see him – really <em>see</em> him, the way he never had in the <em>before</em> of the other man’s question.</p><p>“For all of that, I’m starting to realise how much we are the same.”</p><p>There’s a sharp intake of breath, and it’s Lan Huan’s turn to roll onto his side so he’s facing Jiang Wanyin. Lying down like this, they’re eye to eye, neither of them higher or lower than the other.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s true,” the younger man confesses, his eyebrows furrowed into a frown. “You’re so–” he pauses for a second, searching for words. Makes a frustrated noise when he comes up with nothing. “You’re kind. You’re <em>good</em>. You don’t try to hurt people,” he says, like it’s the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>“But I do hurt people.”</p><p>“Yes, you do. And so does everyone else on this fucking planet. I’m not saying you’re perfect; no one is. But you <em>try</em>, and hell, that’s more than almost anyone can say. Including me.”</p><p>“You’re braver than I am,” Lan Huan says. For once, it doesn’t cost him anything. “Even when it seems impossible, you keep fighting. Even when it’s hopeless.”</p><p>Blue eyes widen. “I lose a lot,” admits Jiang Wanyin. “Sometimes more than I win.”</p><p>“But you <em>try</em>.”</p><p>The echo of his own words stops the other sect leader short. Unconsciously, his hand drifts towards his chest. Towards the scars tracing his skin like map-lines on parchment.</p><p>They’re faded, but they’ll never go away. It’s been too long, the cuts too deep, made with weapons that were always meant to mark forever. And there are too many of them. The younger man was afraid to show them to him, perhaps for good reason. He’d called them hideous, <em>disgusting</em>.</p><p>But there’s barely two inches separating the bare skin of their torsos, and Lan Huan isn’t cringing away. He doesn’t even want to.</p><p>The air is charged. The promise of…something hangs between them. For a moment, Lan Huan keeps his silence, unwilling to break the moment. Waiting for something to happen.</p><p>Then Jiang Wanyin speaks, and shatters it. “That’s all I can do. All either of us can do, I guess. Maybe you <em>are</em> right after all.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“We are the same. But different, at the same time.” Red tints the other sect leader’s cheeks, and Lan Huan feels an inexplicable pang of loss for the youth neither of them really got to have. For the quiet, studious boys who yearned for their parents’ love and approval, and watched their mothers and fathers die before they ever truly received it. “I’m glad.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“You’re very kind, you know, Lan Xichen.” It’s not an answer – just a repetition of something he’s already said. It leaves Lan Huan’s head spinning even as something in his chest flutters at the compliment.</p><p>And then Jiang Wanyin <em>smiles</em>. The perpetual furrow between his brows smooths and his entire face lights up. He is unpracticed at the expression, surely –the entire cultivation world swears up and down that Sect Leader Jiang hasn’t so much as <em>looked pleased</em> in years – but it is bright and so, so beautiful. It makes warmth bloom in Lan Huan’s insides, and– <em>oh</em></p><p><em>Gods in heaven, oh please no</em>.</p><p>The world <em>shifts</em>. Like a key into a lock, and even though Lan Huan hasn’t moved at all, everything settles into place. The shivery feelings the other man’s presence provokes, the way just knowing his visits will come makes Lan Huan’s heart beat faster, the lingering touches even Lan Huan couldn’t understand why he was drawing out…</p><p>He’s in love with Jiang Wanyin. The thought seems slightly tinged with mania.</p><p><em>I’m in love with Jiang Wanyin</em>.</p><p>He looks the other sect leader more fully in the eyes, searching for something that will deny the realisation that has just crashed into him with as much force as any fierce corpse. Clear blue eyes look back, holding something that isn’t quite innocence – how could it, this is <em>Sandu-Shengshou</em> he’s talking about – but it’s pure. Raw. Strong as a summer storm, and unadulterated as the winter’s first snow.</p><p>Lan Huan wants to kiss him.</p><p>And that’s a bucket of ice water all over again, because this is a <em>mess</em>. A complete, unmitigated <em>disaster</em> because Lan Huan’s already sent in his application to the matchmaker and Jiang Wanyin is his <em>best friend</em>. His best friend, who is a man and his brother-in-law and <em>doesn’t like other men.</em></p><p>Which would pose a problem, since Lan Huan is undoubtedly very much male.</p><p>By Yu Huang, Lan Huan is absolutely, spectacularly <em>fucked</em>. And no, that mental imagery is not helping at all, thank you very much, because the man he’s just realised he’s in love with is less than an arm’s length away and wearing only a thin pair of trousers. This is not the time to be thinking about things like <em>that</em>.</p><p>“Are you all right?” The question jolts Lan Huan out of his stupor, bringing him back to reality.</p><p>His face flames red, and he stutters out a “yes” before he’s on his feet again and throwing his robes back on like his life depends on it. <em>Gods</em>, he can barely look Jiang Wanyin in the eye, but he can’t look away from him either.</p><p>“I– I just remembered. I need to go back to do something. I – um, I’m sorry.” He knots the final tie holding his robes in place and bows apologetically.</p><p>The smile is gone from the younger man’s face, his eyes crinkled with what looks like concern. Lan Huan feels something <em>pull</em> in his chest, an answering tug on the strings that hold him together. The moment that registers, the bottom drops out of Lan Huan’s stomach.</p><p>This is worse than he’d feared. Much, much worse.</p><p>Then he gives another hasty bow and retreats, turning his back on the cold springs and the man still standing there, shell-shocked at the drastic turn Lan Huan’s mood has taken. He almost runs back to his cottage, barely even registering the lack of disciples along the corridors – thank the heavens for small mercies – and locks the door behind him.</p><p>He leans against the smooth wood, heart thudding hard as though he’s just sprinted all the way across the Cloud Recesses. He hasn’t – the cold springs aren’t <em>that</em> far away from his secluded cottage and he maintained his speed within the bounds of propriety, albeit narrowly – but he might as well have, from the way his pulse pounds in his ears.</p><p>Lan Huan lifts shaking hands to his forehead, skimming his fingertips along the smooth cloth band he finds there. It usually calms him, but today it’s not enough. He undoes his forehead ribbon – the pride of his sect, what’s wrong with him? – and tangles his fingers in it, breathing deep and slow to calm the mounting panic swelling within him.</p><p>This can’t be real. This can’t be happening. Not to him, never to him. Lan Huan isn’t– isn’t <em>supposed </em>to be like this. This is all wrong.</p><p>A fist clenches, crushing the delicate ivory cloth within it. There will be wrinkles later. Lan Huan presses his fist against his chest, feeling the thumping of his racing heart. Counting the beats.</p><p><em>Shu-Fu is going to be so disappointed in me</em>, he thinks wildly. His throat is tight. <em>It turns out I’m even more like my father than I’d thought</em>.</p><p>His father, who locked himself in seclusion after his wife’s trial and sentencing before the Council. His brother, who gravely wounded thirty-three clan elders defending the Yiling Patriarch, his future husband. Lan Huan was supposed to be the <em>normal</em> one, the <em>ordinary </em>one. The one who stayed sane and above it all, just like his Shu-Fu. Above love.</p><p>He resists the urge to throw back his head and laugh. <em>Excessive noise is prohibited in Cloud Recesses</em>.</p><p><em>Love</em>. The kind of love that burns like a forest fire, that licks greedily at any scrap of fuel and swallows it whole. The kind that decimates entire square miles of trees in days and leaves only a scar upon the earth in its wake. Their family’s greatest curse.</p><p>(Some say it’s their greatest blessing, but blessings don’t get people killed.)</p><p>Later, Lan Huan will protest that he hadn’t meant to fall in love.</p>

    <p>Most people who know Wei Ying know that he has a <em>reputation</em>. Of course he does; he’s the Yiling Patriarch, even though he’d like to think he’s put all that behind him. Still, although he’s rather less…well, insane, than he used to be, it’s rather well-known that Wei Wuxian loves mischief. So much so, in fact, that he’s apparently the ‘chaos’ in his husband’s title of ‘being where the chaos is’.</p><p>Which is what makes his current situation so utterly shocking.</p><p>Wei Ying is <em>bored</em>. Extremely unlikely, he knows – Lan Zhan once told him that <em>nothing</em> is ever boring around him. But somehow, this week is managing to do the impossible.</p><p>He’s barely seen his husband for six days. Not a lot, considering Lan Zhan waited thirteen years for him, but it’s the principle of the matter. And wasn’t that the whole point of getting married? So they’d actually be able to be with each other?</p><p><em>Hmph</em>. Wei Ying knows the cultivation conference was his idea, but honestly, he’d had no idea things like that were this much trouble to organise. His cultivation partner is away practically all the time, buried deep in discussion with Lan Qiren about logistics, hosting details, schedules and gods know what else. It’s enough to make his head spin.</p><p>One of the myriad reasons why he isn’t a sect leader, Wei Ying thinks wryly. He’ll leave the nightmares of planning to people like his husband and younger brother; plans tend to go awry when he’s involved in them.</p><p>But that still leaves him short a husband for a week, and maybe he’s been spoiled by living with Lan Zhan for over a year, but he needs someone next to him to fall asleep now, damnit. This just isn’t doing it for him.</p><p>His mental litany of complaint is interrupted by a loud knock on the door of Lan Zhan’s <em>jingshi</em>.</p><p><em>Ooh. A guest. </em>Wei Ying perks up, interest spiking. It’s probably one of the kids. Ah-Yuan, maybe, with Lan Jingyi. Could be Jin Ling, too. His nephew hasn’t yet sought him ought of his own volition, but anything’s possible.</p><p>“Coming,” he yells, rising from his position on the floor from where he’s been attempting handstands for the past half hour with little to no success. Lan Zhan likes picking him up like he weighs little more than a bag of rice – and don’t get him wrong, that is <em>very</em> hot – but Wei Ying would absolutely love to be able to return the favour one of these days.</p><p>But maybe that’s going to have to wait a little longer.</p><p>He opens the door to a wall of purple and a familiar scowl. It’s weird to be glared down on, instead of glared <em>up at</em>. Even after a whole year, there are still some things about this new body that get him every time.</p><p>“Little brother!”, he greets, feeling his face break out into a grin. His new guest is definitely not one of the kids, but perhaps this is even better. Jiang Cheng, come to <em>him</em>. It’s a day for the records. “Come in, come in.”</p><p>Wei Ying ushers his <em>shi-di</em> inside his house like the gracious host he is– okay, it’s more like he grabs his sleeve and drags him into the living room, slamming the door behind him so Jiang Cheng can’t suddenly change his mind and escape. Jiang Cheng’s eyes widen even as his lips purse into the expression of perpetual disapproval he wore throughout most of their childhood. Strangely, Wei Ying’s heart warms to see it.</p><p>He shoves his younger brother onto the sofa and takes up his own favourite spot, which just so happens to be right next to him. Jiang Cheng’s nose wrinkles, but he doesn’t push him away. Smirking, Wei Ying pats his knee.</p><p>“Tell your <em>shi-xiong</em> what’s wrong,” he says, his tone confiding, like Jiang Cheng’s about to tell him a secret.</p><p>Jiang Cheng splutters. “What the fuck do you mean, <em>what’s wrong</em>? I didn’t even say anything! There’s nothing wrong!”</p><p>Wei Ying taps the side of his nose and shakes his head in mock disappointment. “You’re a terrible liar, Jiang Cheng. I know you didn’t come here for a social call. You’ve got your <em>oh no I have emotions and I don’t want to talk about them</em> face on. Except you’re here, so you obviously want to talk. Now spill.”</p><p>“I never– I don’t–” Jiang Cheng throws his hands up in the air. “I don’t know what I even expected, coming here. Sorry to bother you, I’ll just be going then.”</p><p>He stands up as if to leave, but Wei Ying grabs him by the seat of his pants and drags him back down to the couch. Then he rolls over and sits on his younger brother. By all logic, this should not work. Mo Xuanyu’s body is two inches shorter than Jiang Cheng’s and – even with all the exercises Wei Ying’s been doing lately – about twenty pounds lighter, all of it muscle. But Jiang Cheng doesn’t flip him off, just goes very still and oddly docile.</p><p>It’s unlike him. Any other time, Wei Ying would pry into why that is, but he’s not going to look a gift horse in the mouth. Or gift donkey. Whatever.</p><p>“You’re not going anywhere,” he tells Jiang Cheng sternly, pinning with his best glare. (One that pales in comparison to Jiang Cheng’s own range of displeased expressions, each with its own ranking of ‘pissed-off’. But again: whatever.) In keeping with the oddness of today, Jiang Cheng nods.</p><p>“I’m going to get off you now. If you run or otherwise do anything idiotic, I’ll tell Lan Zhan you pissed me off and let him deal with you himself.”</p><p>“Keep your pet husband away from me.”</p><p>“Only if you behave. Promise you’ll behave.”</p><p>Wei Ying’s little brother rolls his eyes, acquiesces and – with an exasperated sigh that would make Lan Qiren’s beard quiver in envy – curls his pinky finger around Wei Ying’s outstretched one. Finally satisfied, the ex-demonic cultivator rolls off him.</p><p>“So,” he says, straightening his robes just for something to do, “what drove you to come all the way out here? Do you need help with something?”</p><p>Silence is his only answer. Jiang Cheng looks down at his lap, where he’s twisting Zidian around his index finger. Wei Ying really hates that habit. Then, “I wanted to ask you something.”</p><p><em>What the fuck?!</em> Did the world turn on its head when he wasn’t looking? Wei Ying almost chokes on his own spit. His little brother – his stubborn, hardheaded, <em>fiercely independent</em> little brother – is asking for advice? From him?</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s spent so long insulting his life choices – no, not insulting, but disparaging them – that the statement sounds almost too good to be true. To be his big brother again, not just some shadowy figure in his life that he once called <em>shi-xiong</em>, but really and truly his big brother…</p><p>Doing big-brother things, like sitting on him when he’s being stubborn, dragging him into and out of trouble, teaching him about things Wei Ying’s done first because he’s <em>older</em>. It’s been so long since he was the first person Jiang Cheng ran to when he needed help. Wei Ying swallows around the sudden lump in his throat.</p><p>When did that get there?</p><p><em>Okay, play it cool. You’ve got this. Don’t mess up</em>.</p><p>He gives his most winning smile, the one that can sometimes almost get Old Man Lan to turn that almighty frosty look elsewhere. “Ask away. I’m listening.”</p><p>“It’s…about Lan Xichen. We went to the cold springs today, and…something happened.”</p><p>His brother isn’t meeting his eyes, colour high in his cheeks. He’s having difficulty getting the words out. Wei Ying does an internal victory dance. <em>I knew it! Now I just have to figure out how to tell Lan Zhan–</em></p><p>Then Jiang Cheng’s statement catches up to him.</p><p>“Wait a second – did you just say you <em>went to the cold springs today</em>? As in, <em>outside of the secluded area</em>?” Wei Ying’s voice is rising in pitch and volume, disbelief evident in every syllable.</p><p>Jiang Cheng blows out a breath, though his face is even pinker than before. “Yes.”</p><p>“And he went with you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>It’s Wei Ying’s turn to be lost for words. “That’s–” fanstasic. Amazing.<em> Impossible</em>. Lan Zhan’s been trying for over a year to get Zewu-Jun to leave that godsforsaken house. And Jiang Cheng did it in a week.</p><p>“–really big,” he finishes weakly. “I can’t even– Lan Zhan will be so happy.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng growls. Actually <em>growls</em>. “It wasn’t for him. And that wasn’t even the point. Gods, why do you always have to get so side-tracked?”</p><p>And ouch, if that didn’t hurt just a little bit. Wei Ying tries not to wince. His brother doesn’t mean him any harm; or at least he doesn’t think so. He’s just…upset.</p><p>Why is he upset?</p><p>Wei Ying takes a deep breath, then lets it out again. As calmly as he can manage, he asks, “what is it?”</p><p>His brother goes a very interesting colour as he tries to figure out an appropriate response. “I don’t even know,” he says finally, sounding frustrated and like he wants to hit something. “We were…talking, and then he just panicked or something. He turned white and started mumbling something about having to go, then he turned tail and ran away.”</p><p>That gives Wei Ying pause. It doesn’t sound like Zewu-Jun at all. And Jiang Cheng is currently twisting his ring around his finger like he’s screwing on a bottle cap, the scowl on his face instantly recognisable as that one he gets when he’s worried about something and doesn’t want to admit it. <em>Or someone</em>, Wei Ying’s brain suggests unbidden.</p><p>There’s something else there. Something Jiang Cheng isn’t saying. But Wei Ying knows better than to push his luck. He’s fortunate that Jiang Cheng’s even come to him with this much.</p><p>Eventually, he decides on amother question. Hopefully that’s a suitable response. “So. What do you want me to do about it?” Then Wei Ying makes a face, realising what he’s just said. “I mean, you came looking for me for something, right? What do you need me to do?”</p><p>The stubborn set of Jiang Cheng’s jaw gives way. He deflates, suddenly looking very tired and uncertain.</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t know why I came here, okay? I guess I just thought that – hell, I’m not sure what I was thinking – I thought you might know what to do. Maybe you could tell me something. Never mind; it was a stupid idea anyway.”</p><p><em>Oh, Jiang Cheng</em>. Wei Ying’s heart aches a little, but in a warm sort of way. <em>I’m glad you trusted me enough to think I could help, even if you don’t know why. You deserve to be happy; you do. And so does Zewu-Jun. </em></p><p>
  <em>I’m so glad you’ve found someone to care about the way I care about Lan Zhan. That’s all Shi-Jie ever wanted for you, you know. She’d be so proud of you. I’m proud of you too.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Now if only you’d open your eyes and realise it, you thick-headed asshole.</em>
</p><p>“It’s not,” he says firmly, trying to conceal the watering in his eyes. “Tell me everything – I want to help you. Both of you.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Lan Zhan returns to the <em>jingshi</em> at a quarter past eight that night, Wei Ying is waiting up for him. It’s not like it’s hard – he’s always been a night owl, and the Gusu Lan sect’s ridiculous bedtime schedule isn’t something he’s picked up over the past year.</p><p>He’s in the bed they picked out, the two of them – a simple, sturdy carved oak that doesn’t creak <em>too</em> loud, even when Lan Zhan gets a little rough – wearing his nightclothes, a book in hand. He hasn’t been looking at the words for the past fifteen minutes, but he still feels as though his attention has been stolen when Lan Zhan enters the room.</p><p>His husband is beautiful. Wei Ying thinks that every time he sees him, even after months of marriage. Not just outwardly – though that had admittedly been what drew Wei Ying to him when they were children – but on the inside as well. Straight-laced, rule-following, self-disciplined Lan Zhan – he’d thought the man uptight and full of himself for years. But since finally getting to know him, he’s realised that Lan Zhan is righteous, really and truly, unlike anyone Wei Ying’s ever known. He follows rules because he believes it’s the right thing to do, and when he thinks a rule is wrong, he strikes out on his own without hesitation.</p><p><em>How did I get so lucky?</em>, he wonders as he pulls Lan Zhan into a kiss. <em>What could a mess like me have done to ever deserve someone like you?</em></p><p>But he doesn’t voice the thought, much as he would like to. It makes Lan Zhan unhappy when he brings up his feelings of inadequacy, and then Lan Zhan will try to convince him that <em>no, Wei Ying, you’re the one who is too good for me</em>, and Wei Ying will get upset to because how can Lan Zhan not see how amazing he is? It’s a cycle – one they’ve been trying to break ever since their seventh argument and seventh subsequent round of makeup sex over it – because both of them believe they don’t deserve the other.</p><p>When in reality, they’re the only people who could ever make each other happy.</p><p>So he smiles softly up at his husband, draws him hot water for a bath, and brushes Lan Zhan’s hair in between lazy kisses, because Wei Ying likes taking care of him and Lan Zhan likes to let him. It’s sweet and domestic, everything Wei Ying never thought he’d have. It’s everything he could ever want.</p><p>Later when they’re lying in bed, too tired for anything more tonight, Wei Ying brings up all he discussed with Jiang Cheng earlier in the day. Lan Zhan listens quietly the way he does everything else, though Wei Ying can sense the rollercoaster of emotions his husband is going through as the story progresses.</p><p>Most people think Lan Zhan is expressionless and unfeeling. It couldn’t be further from the truth, but only if one knows how to read him. Luckily, Wei Ying is one of the privileged few Lan Zhan feels comfortable enough around to let his guard down.</p><p>And right now, Lan Zhan is feeling…a lot. Elation that his big brother has finally – <em>finally!</em> – taken that first big step out of the tiny cottage he’s locked himself in for the past year. Worried and tense, because said brother apparently panicked over nothing and not-quite-ran away shortly after. But most of all, he’s feeling a whole lot of something that Wei Ying can’t quite pin down. He’s not entirely sure it’s good.</p><p>When Wei Ying reaches the end of the account, he falls silent. Lan Zhan, too, is very quiet. Probably an error on Wei Ying’s part; he <em>knows</em> Lan Zhan never initiates conversation if he can help it–</p><p>“Why him?” His husband’s voice rings out in the dead air. Wei Ying’s head snaps up to look at him. He knows what Lan Zhan is asking (why was it Jiang Cheng who managed to get Lan Xichen out into the world again), knows that tiny little quaver in his voice that only shows up when Lan Zhan is feeling too much for him to deal with.</p><p><em>Oh.</em> Wei Ying gets it now. He wants to pound his head against the wall. Why didn’t he notice this before?</p><p>“Lan Zhan,” he murmurs, sliding his hands up over his husband’s chest and sides to wrap his arms around his back. “Are you jealous of Jiang Cheng?”</p><p>No response. Lan Zhan turns his head into the pillow, hiding half his face. It’s not a no, and Lan Zhan doesn’t lie.</p><p>Wei Ying gently cups his jaw, tilts him so he’s looking his cultivation partner straight in his golden-glaze eyes. He gets a head-shake in answer, signalling that Lan Zhan doesn’t want to talk about this. But the thing about Lan Zhan is that he doesn’t just use words to communicate.</p><p><em>My brother</em>, his eyes say, lashes fluttering and sad, <em>he hurts. He’s been hurting so much for so long; I want him to be happy. I tried – I’m trying – to help him be happy. I’m trying so hard. Why aren’t I enough?</em></p><p>A piece of Wei Ying’s heart tears away at the look on his husband’s face. Defeated, resigned, self-loathing. Lan Xichen’s seclusion isn’t just locking the world away from him, it’s also locking him away from the people he cares about, who care about him. Like Lan Zhan. The man’s own little brother.</p><p>It’s hurting him, too. Wei Ying’s heard the way Lan Zhan talks about his brother, how he looks at him. Lan Zhan’s said before that Wei Ying is his whole world; if that’s true, then Lan Xichen is the gravity that keeps him anchored there. Lan Xichen is his <em>hero</em>.</p><p>Shimmying up on the bed so that he’s level with his husband, Wei Ying plants a soft kiss on his cheek. Then the other. And then he leans forward, brushes his lips against Lan Zhan’s forehead. Whispers against his skin.</p><p>“It’s not your fault. You haven’t done anything wrong. It’s just that sometimes, you can’t help someone all by yourself. You’re a good brother; you are, and you <em>are</em> needed, but maybe he needs other people too.”</p><p>As he speaks, the tightness in Lan Zhan’s muscles drains away bit by bit, until he’s practically sinking into the bed. Wei Ying keeps talking, knowing that’s what the other man needs to hear right now. Telling him he’s a good brother, a good friend, that he’s <em>enough</em> but maybe not everything Lan Xichen needs, and that’s okay. This won’t solve all their problems – they’re probably going to repeat this time and again, but Wei Ying will say it as many times as it takes for Lan Zhan to know that none of this is his fault.</p><p>Finally, when the taller man is calm – at least, relatively speaking – Wei Ying nuzzles into his arms. His tone takes on a more playful note.</p><p>“So, your brother and mine, then?”</p><p>Lan Zhan chokes. “My <em>brother</em>–?!”</p><p>Laughing, Wei Ying nudges him. “And I thought <em>I </em>was the oblivious one. Still jealous, Lan Zhan?”</p><p>“Not jealous.” A pause, and then, “I must speak to my brother.”</p>

    <p>By the time the knock comes on his cottage door the next morning, Lan Huan has taken a bath, filled out the rest of yesterday’s paperwork, meditated, and done enough handstands to leave his arms aching. He has finished two pots of tea and is currently working on a third, courting danger with a fourth brewing on the kitchen stove. He had hoped all this work might increase his productivity and clear away the dregs of the realisation-induced panic from last night. Unfortunately, he was only half right.</p><p>It is seven in the morning, and Lan Huan is still panicking.</p><p>Not in the same way he did yesterday – thankfully, the gods at least aren’t <em>that</em> cruel – he can still breathe, still maneuvre all his limbs, still function. He’s thrown himself into his work, and that’s perfectly fine, but it feels as though his soul has come untethered from his body and is now floating somewhere above the peaks of Cloud Recesses. Try as he might, he can’t reel it in and tie it back down again.</p><p>It’s a little upsetting, this loss of control. But at the same time, it’s oddly reassuring that he can barely feel anything at all. That he’s completely aware that he’s panicking, but in the absence of that particular brand of chest-crushing fear, he can almost ignore it in favour of other things.</p><p>Like the letter currently demanding his attention.</p><p><em>Esteemed sect leader</em>, it reads in graceful calligraphy, perfect, flowing curves that come from years of mastery of the art, <em>we are grateful to have received your response so promptly. Delighted, as well, to hear that you have much the same view of this most important matter as ourselves.</em></p><p>The hairs on the back of Lan Huan’s neck prickle. The wording is…familiar.</p><p>He flips to the end of the letter, checks the way the writer signs off and the order of the signatures below it. <em>Lan Fusha</em>.</p><p>An image of a wrinkled, white-bearded face surfaces in his mind’s eye. A blank expression, his arms crossed, a glint in his eye as the man watched the discipline whip come down across Wangji’s bare back. Leaning on his own cane, his leg and side still healing.</p><p>Spineless, Shu-Fu has called him before, usually accompanied with a disdainful sniff, but sturdy enough not to bend when he has enough people backing him. It is not as though that is difficult for him, seeing as he is the eldest and most senior member of the Lan Council of Elders. Indeed, the unofficial head of it.</p><p>Below his name, there are over thirty signatures, each belonging to one of the Elders. The entire Council’s names are on this letter. Lan Huan skims the contents, and his heart stops beating for a moment.</p><p><em>Oh</em>, he thinks. Out loud, he says, “I think I’m going to need some more tea.”</p><p>He stands up to retrieve the pot he’s left on the kitchen stove, freezing when a sharp knock sounds at the front door. The pounding in his chest resumes, only now easily twice as fast as before.</p><p>It’s too early – the sun has barely begun to rise, the conference isn’t even close to starting yet. What is a visitor doing here? Lan Huan isn’t supposed to have any guests until much later, he’s supposed to have <em>hours</em> to compose himself and get his nerves under control, pretend that nothing is amiss–</p><p>A second knock doesn’t come, and Lan Huan is beginning to grow confused. A patient guest, then, or a courteous one. Lan Huan’s most frequent visitor over the past few days is decidedly neither of those things.</p><p>Setting the letter down, Lan Huan makes his way to the door and pulls it open. His brother’s sombre face greets him. Wangji’s expression has been carefully smoothed over, but there are the beginnings of a crease between his brows where they are just slightly pulled together.</p><p>Lan Huan swallows back a startled exclamation. “<em>Didi</em>, it’s good to see you,” he says instead. He doesn’t fight the way the corners of his mouth pull into a smile, despite the twinge of worry that runs through his chest at the sight of Wangji’s frown.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Ushering his brother inside, Lan Huan pours what has to be his fifteenth cup of tea for them both as they seat themselves on the floor. He takes the opportunity to look Wangji over even as his brother does the same to his house, taking in the neat stack of finished paperwork covering only half the desk, the second set of calligraphy brushes Lan Huan washed last night and left out to dry.</p><p>Then he turns his gaze back to Lan Huan, peering at him over the rim of his mug as he sips at his tea. He hums a little in place of words, boring into him with eyes only a few shades lighter than Lan Huan’s own.</p><p><em>He knows</em>. Lan Huan isn’t sure where the thought comes from, but it makes his stomach sink all the same. For as much as people call Lan Huan a ‘brother-reader’, they often forget that for the two of them, the ability to see inside their brother goes both ways; it’s just that Wangji has always been a little less vocal about what he finds.</p><p>Wangji is the person who knows him best in the world, and he <em>knows</em>. Any faint hope Lan Huan has been harbouring that he might be delusional goes up in a puff of smoke.</p><p>It’s real, then. Lan Huan’s untethered, drifting soul slots back into place with an awful jolt. His palms go clammy, despite the heat of the clay mug grasped between them.</p><p>“You left,” Wangji states bluntly. Lan Huan starts at the sound of his voice. His brother uses it more now, speaks just a bit more often instead of keeping his stoic silence, but sometimes it still takes him by surprise.</p><p>“You heard?”</p><p>“Wei Ying told me.” Lan Huan blinks. <em>Wei Wuxian? How did he– that’s right; his brother.</em> The beginnings of irritation prickle in his gut, until the memory of yesterday surfaces. The concern on Jiang Wanyin’s face, the worry in his eyes Lan Huan barely registered through his panicked haze as he all but ran away. The annoyance turns to shame.</p><p>“Good,” says Wangji, no trace of uncertainty in his voice. “It was good for you.”</p><p>“You– you really think so?”</p><p>His little brother fixes him with another stare. “Yes.”</p><p>Wangji has never been the kind of person to emote, but all the same, Lan Huan hears the words unspoken. <em>I’m glad. You should come out more. </em></p><p>
  <em>I miss you.</em>
</p><p>There’s a lump in Lan Huan’s throat. He makes no effort to clear it. He wants so badly to say back, <em>I miss you too</em>, but he doesn’t. Because that would invite questions he can’t answer.</p><p>The past whispers in his ear. Wangji’s six-year-old voice, high and clear and curious, back before he learned to bury it beneath recited clan rules and monosyllabic responses. <em>Why won’t Ah-Die come to visit us? When is Ah-Niang coming back?</em></p><p>
  <em>Gege, what do you mean, Ah-Niang isn’t coming back?</em>
</p><p>“I guess it was,” he says instead, half out loud and half to himself. And he realises it’s true. It had been so long since he’d ventured beyond the walls of his secluded little space; he’d forgotten what it was like to be in a place he didn’t already know by heart, every ant-nest and grass-blade of it.</p><p>The disciples, too. He’d watched them grow up, then he was gone for a year and suddenly they’d shot up like weeds, their features sharper and voices deeper, hardly recognisable.</p><p>He wonders how Sizhui is doing. Little Sizhui he’d taught to do handstands, now eighteen, a full-fledged cultivator in his own right. Lan Huan wasn’t there for his birthday.</p><p><em>Maybe next year</em>, he thinks. The thought takes him by surprise. When did he start seeing his seclusion as something with an end? When did he start believing that that end was in sight?</p><p>The answer rises behind his eyes, a figure in purple robes and a fierce scowl, but Lan Huan shoves it down.</p><p>“<em>Gege</em>?”, Wangji asks, and suddenly Lan Huan is thrown back ten, twenty, thirty years, to a little boy with dirt on his cheeks and tears in his eyes. “Are you all right?”</p><p>His brother hasn’t called him that in so long. He’d almost forgotten how it sounds. Wangji’s voice is plaintive and small, and like always, Lan Huan hears everything he isn’t saying.</p><p><em>Are you like me</em>, he’s asking. Lan Huan can’t help but think of the scars on his baby brother’s back. The tears that streamed down his face when the whip fell, even as he bit through his lip to hold back his screams. <em>Is that why you never called me disgusting, when you found out how I felt about him?</em></p><p>
  <em>Is it hurting you the way it hurt me?</em>
</p><p>Maybe deep down, Lan Huan has always known this was the way things were going to be. Maybe every desperate bid to keep control of his fickle Lan heart was always going to lead to this last, greatest betrayal. It’s the way of their family, after all. He wants to scream.</p><p>But he doesn’t. He shoves the urge deep down – like he does with everything else these days – and takes his brother’s hand, because Wangji is sad, and he has to fix it. That’s what big brothers are supposed to do, isn’t it? Fix things?</p><p>
  <em>How do you fix what’s wrong when you’re the thing that’s broken?</em>
</p><p>For the first time, Lan Huan can’t answer his brother. He can’t look him in the eye and say he’s fine, because Jiang fucking Wanyin has shown him he’s clearly <em>not</em>. And apparently, he’s a worse actor than he’s always thought because everyone else seems to know it too.</p><p>“How did you know,” he begins, as gently as possible, knowing he’s answering a question with another question that’s not much of an answer at all, “that it was worth it?” <em>That he was worth everything you had to give? How could you stand it, knowing that even that might not be enough?</em></p><p>Wangji’s fingers are calloused from a lifetime of playing the <em>guqin</em>, even more so than Lan Huan’s, rough where they cracked and bled over the sleepless nights of thirteen years. They squeeze tight around Lan Huan’s palm, even though the lost nerves mean that Wangji can barely feel his brother’s hand.</p><p>Lan Huan remembers the first time Wangji got a papercut; the solemn look on his face as the blood welled up. The intensity in his eyes as he watched Lan Huan carefully wipe it off and wrap a completely unnecessary bandage around the tiny wound. The next time Lan Huan cut himself on a practice sword, Wangji insisted on being the one to bandage it.</p><p>Even now, Wangji is still trying to take care of him. Guilt churns Lan Huan’s stomach, even as it is tempered by warmth at the concern.</p><p>
  <em>Would it be so bad to be selfish? Just this once?</em>
</p><p>His little brother seems to be struggling with his words. Explanations, he’s always had trouble with. They’re too long for him; it’s not that he can’t say them, but just that he finds it difficult to choose the perfect words in the perfect order when there are so many he needs to say. Wangji has always wanted everything to be perfect.</p><p>(Lan Huan is sorry he can’t be.)</p><p>Finally, he settles on something and opens his mouth. It’s easy to tell, though, from the set of his lips, that he isn’t quite happy with it.</p><p>“I was afraid,” he says at last. “Of everyone. What they might think. But I was more afraid of losing him.”</p><p>Wangji drains the last of his tea. Looks away from Lan Huan, to the calligraphy brushes laid neatly out on the desk. It’s the most Lan Huan can recall him ever saying at once, at least since he reached adulthood.</p><p>“You love him,” Wangji says. It’s simple, devastating. Asking <em>who</em> doesn’t even cross Lan Huan’s mind. He sits there, frozen, unable to move or speak. He doesn’t say yes. But he doesn’t say no either, and Wangji takes that for the admission it is.</p><p>Lan Huan’s heart aches. Surprisingly, it’s that that makes his throat come unstuck. “You don’t like him.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I’m scared. Wangji, I’m scared.”</p><p>“Good.” <em>It means you still care about what happens to yourself. I’m glad. I’m glad he can be there for you, even if I can’t. Even if I hate him. I can bear it, if he’s helping you</em>.</p><p>He stands, turns to leave. Before he can lose his nerve, Lan Huan whispers a “thank you”. Wangji’s eyes shine with what Lan Huan recognises as a smile.</p><p><em>You’re welcome</em>.</p><p>And then he’s gone, leaving only a closed door in his wake.</p>

          <p>So, a few people have said the LWJ was a little out-of-character in the last chapter. AKA, he probably wouldn't be jealous of JC helping out his older brother, because that's not how their relationship is. A very valid point, and I'm sorry to everyone who sees this as out-of-character. Personally, though, I'd just like to offer up my own take on it.<br/>I apologise if this wasn't very clear, but the jealousy LWJ was experiencing wasn't the toxic kind. It wasn't the kind that's like "you touched my stuff so I want to kill you now" - it was the very natural result of seeing someone he dislikes able to do something that he couldn't. Namely, help his older brother heal. Yes, he was mainly happy for his older brother, but there was a little bit of disappointment and guilt mixed in there too. He wishes he could have been the one to be there for LXC, he's ashamed that he couldn't, and - this is mostly a result of his own strong self-loathing - he's upset because he thinks he did such a bad job of supporting his brother that even JC (who everyone knows is a total disaster) was a better option. It's more of a "you remind me that I've failed" type of bitterness, turned more inwards than outwards.</p><p>Sorry if that doesn't make any sense. I'm not the best at explaining things. Or writing LWJ. (He's very tough to write in-character.) Anyway, in the next chapter, the juniors' (and WWX) plan is revealed in all its manipulative glory. JC isn't going to know what hit him.</p><p>Today's songs are 'Anything' by The Calling, and 'Birthday Girl' by Matt Nathanson.</p>

    <p> </p><p>The next morning, Jiang Cheng wakes with the feeling that something is coming to a close. It’s the last day of the discussion conference, he realises, still half-asleep, and it’s enough to jolt him to wakefulness. Seven days. It’s been seven days, but it feels like an eternity ago that he came to Cloud Recesses.</p><p>It feels like so much has changed since then, but he can’t put his finger on what. The conference itself? His initial projection has held true; they’ve laid the groundwork for an inter-sect Council and the measures it will implement, but it’s nowhere close to becoming a reality. Whatever’s changed, it isn’t that.</p><p>He dresses, does his morning drills, and comes back to roust Jin Ling, who sleeps like he’s in a coma. It’s only then, waiting for his nephew to get ready, that Jiang Cheng finally figures it out.</p><p>It’s <em>him</em>. Somehow, over the course of the past seven days, Jiang Cheng has changed. He’s fought with his brother, made up with him, built a tentative sort of friendship with the secluded Lan sect leader – how he managed that is still beyond him – and has watched as Jin Ling took his first teetering steps towards manhood, towards growing up away from his uncle’s watchful eye.</p><p>It’s a lot. It feels almost overwhelming, because Jiang Cheng’s been stuck in limbo for over fourteen years, ever since Wei Wuxian died. Now everything is changing so fast it takes Jiang Cheng’s breath away, but for some reason, he hasn’t yet come completely untethered. And strangely, he feels more alive than he has since he was eighteen.</p><p>It’s like he’s been barely surviving, just trying to make it from one day to the next, and now he’s <em>living</em>. Jiang Cheng can’t figure out the difference, but he knows that there is one.</p><p>Eventually, though, Jin Ling manages to wrestle himself into something resembling respectability, and Jiang Cheng has to stop wool-gathering and get his ass in gear for the week’s final meeting. A fleeting sense of loss hits him at that thought, but he doesn’t have time to dwell on it because they <em>really need to go</em>.</p><p>When they get to the pavilion, it’s already half-full. It’s not indicative of lateness; it’s just that today, everyone seems to have felt the need to show up early. It’s the last day after all, and for some reason, people have decided to be on their best behaviour. Quite illogical on their part, Jiang Cheng thinks, even as he takes his seat and pours himself a cup of tea. If they haven’t been behaving themselves all week, what use will politeness on the last day achieve?</p><p>But he keeps that thought to himself.</p><p>The meeting itself continues in much the same vein. The atmosphere itself is one of finality; no arguments break out (which Jiang Cheng is thankful for because listening to stupid people snipe back and forth gives him a headache) and everyone is so very <em>civil</em> to one another. As if they haven’t been practically at each other’s throats all week.</p><p>The hypocrisy is unnerving.</p><p>Finally, the meeting adjourns, though the discourse itself is nowhere near its end. The sect leaders each agree to send in four representatives to continue the finalisation of the accords and to form the Council. Then Lan Qiren bangs the gong.</p><p>Just like that, it’s over. No fanfare, no fireworks. That’s how they do things in the Cloud Recesses.</p><p>As everyone streams out, Jiang Cheng’s head is whirling with preparations for his and Jin Ling’s departure. Packing, last-minute notices to send out, the goodbye to Wei Wuxian he can’t avoid if he doesn’t want to be harrassed about it for the next three months. And <em>oh</em>, on the subject of goodbyes…</p><p>Lan Xichen’s smiling face worms its way into his thoughts. Is Jiang Cheng supposed to visit him one last time? <em>Should </em>he?</p><p>A voice in his head states, very reasonably, that today is the last day of the conference after all. He still needs to report the events of this morning’s meeting.</p><p><em>His brother can do that. Wei Wuxian only asked you because Hanguang-Jun was busy, anyway. You probably shouldn’t go</em>.</p><p>The voice tells him to shut up, much less reasonably. It’s only polite, Jiang Cheng thinks. After imposing on him for a whole week, it’s only proper that he bid his host goodbye, and he didn’t to Lan Xichen yesterday. But still…</p><p>The mention of yesterday dredges up the memory of Lan Xichen’s panic, and worry curls through Jiang Cheng’s gut. Everything had been going – if not well then at least more or less <em>alright</em> – and then Jiang Cheng called him kind and apparently that triggered the Lan sect leader into freaking the fuck out. Hell, the guy practically tripped over himself in his hurry to get away.</p><p>The growing sense of guilt in his chest wars with the need to see if Lan Xichen is alright. If he’d made it back to his cottage in one piece, without getting ensnared in his own mind again, dragged so far down he forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Which had also been Jiang Cheng’s fault. Damnit.</p><p>Maybe Lan Xichen doesn’t want to see him again. Maybe like everyone else, he’s finally realised that Jiang Cheng is only tolerable in small doses, and has decided he’s seen entirely too much of the little Jiang Cheng has to offer.</p><p>Jiang Cheng wouldn’t blame him. Still, the thought makes his heart hurt entirely too much for a friend he’s only had for the better part of a week.</p><p><em>It’s not about you</em>, he reminds himself sternly. That much has always been true, ever since he was a child. <em>And anyway, you’re not much of a friend if the only thing you ever do is remind him of things he’d rather forget.</em></p><p>“Uncle?” A tug comes on his robes. “Uncle!”</p><p>Jin Ling’s voice. Jin Ling’s hand, too, pulling on his sleeve, the same way he used to when he was a toddler and saw something interesting. <em>Uncle, look!</em></p><p>With a jolt, Jiang Cheng returns to reality. His nephew has come to a stop in front of him, looking at him with a mixture of concern and annoyance. He seems to have been calling Jiang Cheng for the past several seconds, getting progressively more frustrated at his uncle’s lack of response.</p><p>“Are you even listening to me?”, Jin Ling huffs, arms folded across his chest. Every inch the prissy young master. An inexplicable wave of fondness crests over Jiang Cheng, accompanied by a swell of irritation.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The response is automatic, snapped out before Jiang Cheng even realises what he’s saying. He glances around, noticing for the first time that they’re a good distance from the conference pavilion, in one of the long, empty corridors that run vein-like through the Cloud Recesses.</p><p>Abruptly, the apparent annoyance drains from Jin Ling’s expression. He swallows.</p><p>“I told you I wanted to talk to you about something,” he says, no longer sounding petulant. His eyes large and serious – Ah-Jie’s eyes.</p><p>Despite that, Jiang Cheng feels his own eyes narrow. He sighs. “What did you do this time?”</p><p>A brief flash of hurt surfaces on his nephew’s young face before it’s hidden away again. That look is like a punch to Jiang Cheng’s gut; he immediately wants to retract the words, but it’s too late. He’s seen the mask Jin Ling uses to conceal his emotions. Jiang Cheng wonders who the kid got it from, and the answer to that hurts even more. It was probably him.</p><p>“Nothing, Uncle,” says the boy, gaze cast downwards.</p><p>“Then?” Jiang Cheng tries to gentle his tone. He’s not sure how successful the effort is.</p><p>“I just– I was just wondering if I could stay here.” Jin Ling’s words are muffled by the angle his head is tilted at, but Jiang Cheng hears them all the same. Something cold takes root in his stomach. “After the conference is over. I mean, now that it’s over.”</p><p>His voice sounds like it’s coming from very far away. Suddenly, the cold spreads to the rest of Jiang Cheng’s body. “Why?”</p><p>Jin Ling almost flinches. Almost. Jiang Cheng sees how his body tenses. It makes him feel hollow. “I was thinking that maybe I could go to school here. You did, didn’t you, Uncle? When you were my age? With Wei Wuxian, and Hanguang-Jun? And my father.”</p><p>“Hmm.” There’s nothing else that Jiang Cheng can say. Nothing he dares to. Jin Ling wants to leave. Jin Ling wants to leave <em>him</em>.</p><p>He should have seen this coming.</p><p>Jin Ling seems to take his grunt as a signal to continue. His head lifts, the words coming faster now. “Everyone says the Cloud Recesses is a good school, and I could learn things here. Like you did, like Sect Leader Lan did, and all the other sect leaders. Sizhui is here too, and Lan Jingyi. I can’t count all the times you’ve said I need to learn discipline, and this place has over four thousand rules, so I guess that helps in some way…”</p><p>His nephew goes on, rapid-fire chatter turning to white noise in Jiang Cheng’s ears. Jin Ling is making many good points, compelling arguments and well-reasoned ones, if a little choppy. But Jiang Cheng can barely hear them over the sound of <em>Jin Ling is leaving</em>.</p><p>He’s always known this would happen. Has been preparing for it, even. But he thought he’d have a bit more time first.</p><p>“…thought it would be a good idea.” Jiang Cheng tunes back in just in time for Jin Ling to look askance at him, pleading for his permission. There’s something in his eyes, something hopeful, because of fucking <em>course</em> there is. He wants to say no, he really does. Wants to wrap Jin Ling in his arms like he’s two again and wailing at the world, crying for his parents, and tell him <em>I won’t ever let you go</em>. But he can’t.</p><p>His nephew’s too old for that now; and anyway, Jiang Cheng should never have been in that position in the first place. He’s not the boy’s fucking father. They buried <em>that</em> poor sucker in the ground years ago.</p><p>“Alright,” he says, because that’s all there is to say. It sounds like someone else’s voice. “You can stay.”</p><p>“Really?” Then the kid blushes. “I mean, that’s it? You’re not going to argue with me? Or scold me for asking at the last minute or anything?</p><p>“I could do that too, if you’d prefer.”</p><p>“No, no, that’s good. Thanks, Uncle.” The childlike excitement in Jin Ling’s expression is the final twist of the knife. No – not the final. Another; just another. The knife never stops twisting, not for Jiang Cheng.</p><p>Dully, he says, “I’ll inform Sect Leader Lan, then, about lengthening my stay. If you are to remain here, some of the logistical details need sorting out first. I’ll get it settled, and then you can start here for the new school year.”</p><p>Jin Ling mumbles something that Jiang Cheng can’t quite make out. It sounds vaguely like <em>that’s what Jingyi was counting on, the crazy bastard</em>, but that can’t be right. Jiang Cheng is on the verge of snapping at his nephew to repeat himself, when the brat thanks him again and disappears down the way they came, muttering to himself the whole while.</p><p>Then he’s gone, with only the memory of his words to remind Jiang Cheng that he was ever there at all. It hits him that soon, that’s what his life is going to be like.</p><p>He twists Zidian around his finger, but the gesture doesn’t do any good. The ring doesn’t even throw off a few comforting sparks. <em>You brought this upon yourself</em>, it tells him, the metal glinting accusingly under the late morning sunlight. The voice sounds like his Ah-Niang.</p><p>With an effort, he forces his feet to move forward. He’s going to have to visit Lan Xichen after all, he supposes.</p>

    <p>When the knock finally comes on his door just before noon, Lan Huan can’t help the sense of relief that floods through him, or the anticipation fluttering in his chest. Mixed with a healthy dose of guilt, of course, because self-flagellation is the Lan way and Lan Huan doesn’t deserve the happiness that his traitorous heart so stupidly craves.</p><p><em>He came</em>, he thinks, even as his stomach dips with the knowledge of <em>he’s going to say goodbye.</em> And for the last time, too.</p><p>There will be no more afternoon conversations, no one sharing his too-small writing desk and grumbling absent-mindedly about paperwork as Lan Huan listens with half an ear. There will be no one to splutter at Lan Huan’s terrible jokes, or scold him when he sets the kitchen on fire.</p><p>No one to remind him <em>you can do this; and this, and this too.</em> To ask him <em>what do you want?</em> and listen for the answer.</p><p>His thoughts are horribly maudlin, he realises. It’s been all of seven days. No one person could have changed his life so completely in such a short time. It’s not possible.</p><p>There’s another knock on the door, this time sharper, more impatient. Lan Huan goes to open it, and at the sight of Jiang Wanyin’s characteristic glower, he remembers too late that the motto of the Jiang sect is <em>do the impossible</em>.</p><p>Or some derivative thereof.</p><p>To his eternal shame, Lan Huan doesn’t even have to reach for the smile that spreads across his own face. He ushers the younger man inside, pouring the first two cups of what looks to be Lan Huan’s seventh pot of tea this morning. At least, he thinks it’s his seventh; he lost count somewhere around pot number five.</p><p>As Jiang Wanyin recounts the events of the meeting – the <em>last</em> meeting, Lan Huan’s mind can’t help adding – the tension that Lan Huan had noticed before seems to bleed out of him. His posture relaxes, the scowl on his face smooths until there’s barely a crease left between his brows.</p><p>Still, Lan Huan can tell there’s something amiss. Something in the way he holds himself, loose but not quite relaxed, like a snake coiled up and waiting to strike. Or dart away. With Jiang Wanyin, it’s difficult to tell.</p><p>The question is on the tip of his tongue, but he keeps silent. That’s how they work, after all; Jiang Wanyin pushes, and Lan Huan waits. And somehow, between the two of them, they manage to stumble into each other.</p><p>Finally, the younger man comes to the end of his recounting. There is a swelling in Lan Huan’s chest that feels like a bubble about to pop. This is it, then. There are no more meetings, no more reports to give, no more excuses for the Jiang sect leader to come find Lan Huan in his cottage in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>
  <em>Is he going to leave?</em>
</p><p>But his eyes flicker to the floor, then back up to Lan Huan, though he still doesn’t look him in the eyes. When he takes a breath and begins to speak, it isn’t to say goodbye. (Lan Huan is stupidly grateful.)</p><p>“I have a request to make,” he says haltingly. The sun spills in through the windows, splashing across his face. His eyes catch the light and they shine. Blue, so blue, and Lan Huan digs his fingers into his thighs to hide their trembling.</p><p>“Go on.” Lan Huan does his best to smile. <em>Anything</em>, he wants to say. He feels like a fraud.</p><p>“I’ve decided to send Jin Ling to study at the Cloud Recesses. Well, really he decided for me, but I have been considering it for some time, and the two of us agree that would be best for his education to come here.” It’s almost imperceptible, but his voice hitches on the word ‘agree’. “I would like to discuss the matter with you, if you’re amenable.”</p><p>And just like that, it’s back to business. But that’s not what catches Lan Huan’s attention, and just like before, he chooses not to comment.</p><p>Instead, he offers cautiously, “student negotiations take time.”</p><p>“That is why I am extending my stay here.” Jiang Wanyin’s ridiculously blue eyes flicker with something Lan Huan can’t identify. Despite all his best efforts, Lan Huan’s treacherous heart leaps.</p><p>“Oh. How long?”</p><p>“Another week perhaps. Shorter, I think – maybe four days, at minimum. I would like…” He trails off, seemingly embarrassed. Red rises to his cheeks and Lan Huan realises that that is a very good look on him. “I would like to make the arrangements with you.”</p><p>“Not my uncle?”</p><p>“No,” he says. “You’re far more reasonable, and much less likely to scold me if I curse in front of you. Your uncle would demand I write lines, at the very least.”</p><p>“Ah, I see. You’re taking advantage of me.” The tight feeling in Lan Huan’s chest lightens at the soft laugh that escapes from the other sect leader.</p><p>“It’s you or your relatives. I much prefer you,” Jiang Wanyin says. There is nothing in his voice but sincerity. “And Jin Ling’s education is important.” <em>To me.</em> Lan Huan can hear the unspoken words as clearly as if he’d shouted them.</p><p>His chest warms. His attempts to quiet it do not meet with much success. But as Lan Huan studies the man opposite him, he finds his limbs still tense, his jaw still set as though he’s preparing for a fight.</p><p>Lan Huan cannot keep silent any longer.</p><p>“Is there something wrong?”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin recoils. “What?”, he responds, taken aback. Then he seems to recover himself. “No. Nothing’s wrong.”</p><p>His voice is flat. <em>Lying is prohibited in Cloud Recesses.</em> The words bubble up in him and Lan Huan has to bite his tongue to hold them back.</p><p>“Are you sure? I can see, you know. Something’s troubling you.” He keeps his tone gentle, soothing. The one he used whenever Wangji had a nightmare and didn’t want to tell him about it. Then, too late, he remembers that what Jiang Wanyin hates more than anything else is being patronised.</p><p>Oh, well.</p><p>“Nothing’s wrong,” he says again. Stubbornly, as though he’s trying to convince himself more than Lan Huan. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“I thought you told me not to say that. It was good advice.”</p><p>The younger man sets his jaw. “That was different.” His eyes are full of sadness, and Lan Huan’s chest aches for him. Right beneath his ribs; the same place Jiang Wanyin has his scar. <em>Scars</em>.</p><p>“It’s all right to ask for help, you know.”</p><p>“I do know that.”</p><p>“Even when it comes to you.” Lan Huan tries to ease the sting of the words with a smile. He’s not sure it works, because the other sect leader’s shoulders slump, his gaze falling to the floor.</p><p>Truthfully, Lan Huan understands. It’s easy to offer help to other people, to listen to their troubles and lend a hand to fix them. But being on the other end is so much harder. There’s always the fear of looking weak, of confessing your worries or sadness and having someone say <em>that’s not worth it. It doesn’t matter</em>.</p><p>Because the thing is, it always matters.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin’s voice is gruff when he finally replies. “It’s nothing I haven’t dealt with before. I can handle it on my own.”</p><p>There’s a note of finality in there, of determination, so Lan Huan decides to let this go. If only because the other man seems to have taken his point to heart. Though he has yet to actually follow his own advice.</p><p><em>Baby steps</em>, he tells himself. Jiang Wanyin is learning. They both are.</p><p>“If you’re sure,” Lan Huan says at last. The other man makes a noise of affirmation.</p><p>They sit in silence for a while, neither of them having anything to say, but it’s not uncomfortable. They’ve long passed the point of awkwardness and stuttering around each other – blew through that somewhere around the first time Lan Huan ended up sobbing on Jiang Wanyin’s shoulder for half an hour – and it makes Lan Huan’s heart hurt with how <em>easy</em> it is to be alone with him. How it makes Lan Huan feel almost like a person again.</p><p>Then, finally, the other sect leader looks over at Lan Huan’s desk, papers piled high in a neat stack on the right side of it. His eyes alight on the lone scroll sitting innocuously in the centre, half-unrolled. The only letter Lan Huan has barely touched.</p><p>Ah, yes. He was wondering how long it would take for the younger man to notice that, and also half-hoping that he wouldn’t. But now that he has, well, Lan Huan can’t help but feel a sense of relief that he’ll be able to tell someone about it. To get it off his chest.</p><p>“That,” Lan Huan begins, answering Jiang Wanyin’s unspoken question, “is the Council’s reply to the letter I sent out a few days ago. It contains the matchmaker’s response and the list of female cultivators that the Council thinks suitable.” <em>To be my wife</em>, he doesn’t say. The thought tastes like ashes in his mouth.</p><p>The other man is staring, dark eyes wide and looking at Lan Huan like he can see through him. And <em>gods</em>, everything’s a mess, isn’t it, because here Lan Huan is talking about his future wife and all he can think about is how he wants Jiang Wanyin to look at him like that always. Like Lan Huan is the only person in the world.</p><p>
  <em>What if– maybe he–</em>
</p><p>Lan Huan cuts the thought off before he can finish it, and tamps down the pang in his chest that feels a little too much like hope. He isn’t his brother, Jiang Wanyin isn’t his, and fairy-tale endings are too few and far between for a man like him.</p><p>“Would you like to see?”, Lan Huan continues instead. He doesn’t know why he’s doing this to himself.</p><p>Wordlessly, the other man stretches out a hand and Lan Huan passes him the paper. He unrolls it. Lan Huan watches his eyes flick down the page, scanning the names and the Council’s remarks. He’s actually <em>reading</em> it, and from the furrow in his brow, is putting some consideration into how. For some reason, this matters to him.</p><p>Lan Huan tries not to think about how that makes him feel.</p><p>When he’s finished, Jiang Wanyin hands the scroll back to him. He settles back on his heels, fixing Lan Huan with his focused gaze anew. This time it’s piercing – Lan Huan would almost say clinical, except for the strong emotion that seem to infuse everything the other man does – and Lan Huan feels as though he’s being studied. Examined, though it still remains unclear what for.</p><p>“The guy who wrote that is an asshole,” Jiang Wanyin says finally. Bluntly, perhaps too much so. Caught off-guard, Lan Huan can’t help but chuckle.</p><p>“What makes you say that?”</p><p>“You can just tell.” Lan Huan raises an eyebrow, and the younger sect leader huffs. “That, and I remember him from a couple sect meetings. The war ones too, from the campaign. A bit bloodthirsty, wasn’t he, for one of you Lans?”</p><p>Lan Huan hums. He refuses to either confirm or deny this.</p><p>“Of course, it’s not like I have any room to talk.”</p><p>“He was the one that pushed the hardest for Wangji’s punishment after… after Nightless City.” He doesn’t know what compels him to say that, but the words burst out of him regardless. “I still haven’t quite forgiven him for that.”</p><p>And now he’s organising your marriage. Gods, what a nightmare.”</p><p>Lan Huan laughs again. Even to his ears, it sounds bitter. “I guess you could say that.” He gestures at the scroll, and the characters on it. “What do you think, about the recommendations? I’ve never done this before, and, well, I haven’t left the Cloud Recesses in a year, so…”</p><p>He waves a hand vaguely, feeling foolish. Everything about this situation is frankly ridiculous. Lan Huan is sure that if he cared more, he’d be appalled with himself. But to be honest, he doesn’t have the energy to.</p><p>“Give it over,” Jiang Wanyin calls, and Lan Huan obliges. The other man unrolls the scroll, placing it between the two of them so Lan Huan can see. In this position, their knees are brushing. It takes all of Lan Huan’s (admittedly impressive) focus to concentrate on the paper itself, rather than that.</p><p>“I don’t know all of them, but I do recognise a few,” says the younger sect leader, dipping his head to look at the characters. A few stray hairs escape from his severe bun, wisping around his face. He points at the third name on the list that spans over thirty female cultivators – <em>thirty!</em> – jabbing his finger at the inked characters. <em>Wu Xiumei</em>.</p><p>“I remember her from my first try at this thing,” he remarks. “Can’t imagine why she isn’t married yet; I thought she was pretty all right.”</p><p>Lan Huan can’t help the tinge of sourness that creeps into his voice. “Then why didn’t the two of you work out?”</p><p>Luckily, Jiang Wanyin doesn’t seem to pick up on it. “We had a, um, misunderstanding.”</p><p>Lan Huan’s eyebrow shoots up. “Now <em>this </em>I have to hear.”</p><p>The other man turns faintly red. He ducks his head to hide it, but the tips of his ears are flushed pink. Despite himself, Lan Huan’s heart goes a little soft at the sight.</p><p>“You have to understand that I’d never been on a date before,” Jiang Wanyin begins, still looking like he’d very much like to crawl into a hole and die of embarrassment. <em>Oh, this is going to be good</em>. “No one had coached me on the proper etiquette; I was barely nineteen, so everything I knew about courtship was from Wei Wuxian’s shitty romance novels–”</p><p>Lan Huan can’t help himself. “<em>Wei Wuxian</em>’s shitty romance novels? Not yours?”</p><p>“Shut up. Do you want to hear the story or not?”</p><p>“Sorry,” replies Lan Huan, not the least bit repentant.</p><p>The younger man glowers at him, then sits up a bit straighter and continues. “Anyway, everything was going fine until the end of it, and then I made the mistake of trying to kiss her goodbye.”</p><p>A noise escapes Lan Huan’s throat without his permission. He’s not sure, but he thinks it sounds like a dying cat. “You– <em>oh</em>,” he gasps, struggling to reign in his laughter. Jiang Wanyin’s glare grows fiercer even as his cheeks grow pinker. He’s nearly the colour of a ripe pomegranate by the time Lan Huan manages to get himself under control again.</p><p>“Are you done yet?”, he asks, but there is less anger there than exasperation, and Lan Huan can detect a faint hint of fondness in his voice.</p><p>“My apologies.”</p><p>“You better be fucking sorry. She punched me afterwards, you know. Damn near broke my nose; I couldn’t breathe right for a week.”</p><p>Lan Huan tells himself very firmly that he is <em>not</em> going to laugh. He is very proud of himself when only a tiny puff of air escapes his mouth. “I see,” he says, as seriously as he can. And then, “I’m surprised the two of you aren’t already married.”</p><p>“She didn’t want anything to do with me after that,” Jiang Wanyin tells him, shrugging. “Honestly, I can’t blame her.”</p><p>“I like her already,” Lan Huan replies with a laugh.</p><p>“You would, wouldn’t you? She’s very…opinionated. Your Council would probably hate her if you two actually were to marry.”</p><p>Lan Huan sobers up at that. <em>If you two were to marry</em>. If Lan Huan binds himself for life to a woman he knows nothing of besides what others have told him.</p><p>It’s everything he’s always wanted. Clean, neat, over and done with quickly; just a round in the matchmaker’s sitting room and then a wedding. He doesn’t think he’d even cry when the veil was lifted. Everything bloodless, no sacrifice and destruction and scars for both parties (and everyone around them) to bear. It’s everything he’s always wanted, he thinks again.</p><p>But now it’s staring him in the face, and for the first time, Lan Huan realises that it isn’t that cut and dry. There’s no love in an arranged marriage, just stilted formalities and an awkwardness that only fades with years of companionship.</p><p>He always thought he’d be all right with that. But now, he’s not sure anymore.</p>

    <p>There is no protocol for this, Jiang Cheng thinks, the names of the cultivation world’s most eligible bachelorettes in his hand. For over a decade, he’s barely spared a glance at the list that gets published every year. He’s had neither the time nor the inclination to care, and now suddenly he’s going over it with a fine-toothed comb, evaluating potential <em>wives</em> for Lan Xichen. Who just so happens to be the leader of the Gusu Lan sect.</p><p>Jiang Cheng feels like a gossipy fishwife as he wracks his brain for any details about the women on the list to share with Lan Xichen. The man’s been in seclusion for over a year; as little as Jiang Cheng is likely to know, <em>he</em> probably knows even less.</p><p>Still, he can’t help but wonder if he’s overstepping his bounds here. These aren’t his affairs – this isn’t even his sect! – and Jiang Cheng has no right whatsoever to interfere in the selection of the future mistress of Gusu. Lan Xichen’s Council would probably rend him limb from limb if they were to find out.</p><p>But Lan Xichen asked him for advice, and strangely enough, Jiang Cheng finds himself willing to give it. He doesn’t know what prompts him to actually admit to that embarrassing story about the date that was his first encounter with the horrors of the cultivation world’s matchmaking machine. It’s not something he goes around telling people. For obvious reasons.</p><p>(Mostly because it’s really fucking humiliating.)</p><p>Yet the look on Lan Xichen’s face when he heard it – the surprised smile, the warm amusement, the choked-off laugh he let out, like he could barely contain himself… Perhaps the humiliation was worth it, if it got him to smile like that.</p><p>Then a strange expression takes over the other man’s gentle features, like he’s thinking about something very far away. Something very sad. His smile falters and his eyes lose their shine, and suddenly Jiang Cheng wants nothing more than to bring it back.</p><p>He really must be getting soft then, as to his horror, his mouth opens of its own volition and suddenly he’s telling Lan Xichen about the <em>rest</em> of his matchmaking disasters. The woman whose name he’d forgotten because Jin Ling was sick and kept him up all night crying, which then made him sick too. The meeting he’d shown up to right after a night hunt, covered in blood and cursing to the high heavens at the idiot who’d missed the fucking flesh-eating zombie and shot him instead. Who had also happened to be his prospective date’s beloved older brother.</p><p><em>Please stop</em>, Jiang Cheng’s last functioning brain cell begs his motor mouth. <em>You’re destroying all our credibility. Not to mention our dignity</em>.</p><p><em>What dignity?</em>, the voice in his head shoots back, and carries right on with it.</p><p>But as Jiang Cheng talks, he notices Lan Xichen coming back to himself. His gaze getting less far away, his smile growing a little more solid. Lan Xichen gets lost in his thoughts a lot, he’s noticed. Needs reminding sometimes that he exists. That he’s real.</p><p>Jiang Cheng guesses that if the price of that is the last of his self-respect, well then Lan Xichen can have it. It’s not like he was using it.</p><p>By the time he’s done, the other man is grinning and laughing again, countering Jiang Cheng’s embarrassing stories with a few of his own – the more ridiculous proposals he’s received from more than a few smitten cultivators, both male and female. All of them unsolicited.</p><p>Jiang Cheng knows them all already, of course. As he’s said before, they’re highly entertaining and the sort of gossip he doesn’t mind indulging himself in. (Without anyone else’s knowledge, obviously. It wouldn’t do to have his sect thinking that he’s some sort of rumour-monger.)</p><p>But to hear it from Lan Xichen is something else entirely. He was <em>there</em>, for starters, and stories are always better from the source. More than that, though, much like he is at everything else, he’s a gifted storyteller. His train of thought flows logically and coherently, and he recounts events with the same wicked sense of humour that has so surprised Jiang Cheng over the past few days.</p><p>He’s just getting to the end of a particularly colourful story involving a very determined merchant’s daughter, three mountain goats and a Lanling Jin sect member’s underwear, when Jiang Cheng – who at this point, is practically suffocating himself trying to keep from laughing – sees the perfect opportunity for revenge. He takes a deep breath, holds it for a second to make sure it doesn’t come out as a giggle or something equally inane, and cuts in.</p><p>“I’m surprised the two of you aren’t already married,” he says. A wicked smirk plays on his lips as Lan Xichen gapes at him.</p><p>“I can’t believe you would say something like that,” the older man exclaims, hand over his heart in a gesture of mock offense. “You have no idea what she asked me to do.”</p><p>“What did she ask, then? Enlighten me.”</p><p>“Well, she– she –” As he splutters his way through his non-explanation, for the first time, Lan Xichen turns bright red. Blood fills his cheeks and flushes his face, and Jiang Cheng’s mouth inexplicably goes a bit dry. It’s a good look on him.</p><p>Jiang Cheng scowls inwardly and endeavours to ignore himself.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Lan Xichen’s head dips. Finally, he mutters shyly, “she asked me to do something rather inappropriate with Liebing. To her, I mean. I thought she was going to eat me alive.”</p><p>“Your <em>xiao</em>?” Jiang Cheng is the very picture of confusion. “What would she want with that?”</p><p>The older man colours further, mumbles something indecipherable. For some reason, something clicks into place in Jiang Cheng’s brain and suddenly, he gets it. Mortification floods him. His ears go as hot as Lan Xichen’s face must feel.</p><p>A sour feeling curls in his chest too, at the thought of some nameless, faceless woman doing <em>that</em> to his friend. Or his friend doing it to her. The sourness intensifies. Jiang Cheng yanks it out by the roots, shoves it in a box and sits on the lid. (In his mind, at least.)</p><p>“Oh,” he says faintly. “I’m sorry I asked.”</p><p>Despite how embarrassed he must feel, Lan Xichen still finds it within himself to laugh at him. That’s good, Jiang Cheng thinks, surprised at how little anger he feels – actually, he feels none at all. Lan Xichen has a nice laugh. Deep, low and honest, and it makes his polished-gold eyes melt and shine.</p><p><em>Where the hell is all this coming from? </em>Jiang Cheng halts his thoughts before they can lead anywhere strange. Well, strang<em>er</em>. He’s not a poet; what’s with all the metaphors? And why the fuck is he using them to describe Lan Xichen’s <em>eyes</em> of all things?</p><p>He must be going insane. There’s no other explanation for it.</p><p>Jiang Cheng changes the subject. “Speaking of Liebing, do you play often?”</p><p>It’s a clumsy attempt at diversion, but Lan Xichen seems to take it in stride. He tilts his head, considering.</p><p>“Sometimes,” he says, a cloud passing over his face. “Less than I used to.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“It just doesn’t really feel…right anymore.”</p><p><em>Oh</em>. Even as his brows draw together, Jiang Cheng’s stomach drops in understanding. Of course it wouldn’t feel right – his <em>xiao</em> is a reminder of his brothers. His lost brothers, the ones who hurt and killed each other, who used him as a go-between, a toy to push around in the dark. And now the lights have come on again, the children have left, and the toy is just now discovering that somewhere along the line, someone has broken it.</p><p>Playing – even just <em>touching</em> – Liebing must feel like pressing on an open wound with a palm full of salt. Jiang Cheng had felt the same way every time he so much as looked at Chenqing. Every time he was reminded that it was there.</p><p>(He had carried it around everywhere.)</p><p><em>It’s yours</em>, he wants to say to Lan Xichen. <em>It’s yours, and you can’t let them take that away from you, do you understand? You can’t let anyone take it from you, because then they’ll just keep taking and you won’t have anything left.</em></p><p>Nothing left that’s <em>his</em>, because it will all be <em>theirs</em>, and he won’t be able to touch it anymore. It’s already started. It won’t stop, not unless Lan Xichen gets out fast.</p><p>But Jiang Cheng doesn’t say any of this. He’s not talented with words, not the way Lan Xichen is, and he doesn’t know how to say it without messing everything up and sounding like a complete and utter asshole. Or thoroughly failing to get his point across.</p><p>“How about your <em>guqin</em>?”, he asks instead. His father’s voice whispers in his ear. <em>Start small. Understand the situation before you change anything</em>.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s lips curve into a tiny smile. “That, I play more often. Nearly every day.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say in response. A nice “oh”, maybe. Perhaps a grunt, or some sort of inane comment or platitude, and that will be that. But what actually comes out of his mouth is, “would you play now?”</p><p>That amber stare is back, levelled at Jiang Cheng with the intensity of a man trying to solve a puzzle. Jiang Cheng shifts uncomfortably. He doesn’t know what on earth possessed him to say that. It’s a stupid request. It’s not like him to say something like that.</p><p>He can just imagine the merchant girl from Lan Xichen’s story asking the same question, hands pressed to her chest like a plea, coy and starry-eyed and impossibly wicked at the same time. <em>Please, for me?</em>, she’d ask, fluttering her lashes. Jiang Cheng’s stomach turns at himself.</p><p>Pathetic. <em>Disgusting</em>.</p><p>“You don’t have to,” he says hurriedly, feeling rather like someone trying to run backwards and tripping over an unfortunately-placed tree branch. “Never mind. Forget I asked.”</p><p>For a second, Lan Xichen’s stare intensifies. Then he gets to his feet. Walks down the hall and disappears into what Jiang Cheng knows is his bedroom. “One moment,” he calls from the inside.</p><p>Just when Jiang Cheng is beginning to sink to the depths of confusion, he reappears. A long wooden slab cradled in his arms, the light glinting off its polished surface, seven strings laid over the top of it. His <em>guqin</em>.</p><p><em>Why?</em>, Jiang Cheng thinks. Lan Xichen is well within his rights to refuse such a ridiculous request. Why would he acquiesce? Surely it can’t be just because Jiang Cheng <em>asked</em>.</p><p>The other man returns to his previous position opposite Jiang Cheng, bringing his legs underneath him in a single fluid motion. Even after a week in his company, Jiang Cheng has not stopped noticing his seemingly effortless grace, though he has long stopped envying it.</p><p>Such elegance is something he can never hope to emulate. It’s much easier to simply admire instead.</p><p>Lan Xichen sets his <em>guqin</em> atop his knees with the ease of years of practice. Long fingers fiddle with the ends of the seven strings, making fine adjustments to the tuning. Jiang Cheng knows from countless night-hunts alongside Lan disciples that those strings are razor-sharp; that they can sever a man’s head from his spine as easily as any sword.</p><p>“Does it have a name?”, he asks. It’s a legitimate question this time. Most people from Gusu name their <em>guqin</em>s if they have them. He’s never heard of Lan Xichen’s instrument having one, but one never knows. Perhaps he named it when he was young and is embarrassed of it now.</p><p>Gods know Jiang Cheng himself has never advertised the names of his childhood canine companions. He gets enough grief from Wei Wuxian as it is for <em>Princess, Jasmine</em> and <em>Love</em>. His older brother has never listened to his perfectly reasonable argument that he’d been all of eight years old at the time.</p><p>But Lan Xichen shakes his head. “I never quite got around to it,” he says. “I think I used up all my creativity naming Liebing and Shuoyue, and by the time I was ready to start thinking about my <em>guqin</em>, I’d had it for so long that it felt redundant.”</p><p>A smile cracks the corner of Jiang Cheng’s mouth. “It’s only redundant if you decide it is.”</p><p>“What do you think I should name it, then?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks back at him, stunned. “<em>Me?</em>” No one ever, <em>ever</em> asks Jiang Cheng to name things. No one who knows him, anyway. Hell, even Ah-Jie asked Wei Wuxian to name Jin Ling. That had stung a bit; he’d like to think he could have done a bit better than <em>Jin Rulan</em>.</p><p>That’s a fucking girl’s name. And Jin Ling <em>hates</em> it.</p><p>“Yes, of course. This was your idea,” Lan Xichen points out logically.</p><p>Jiang Cheng goes quiet for a while, wracking his brains. Unbidden, his hand goes to Zidian, twisting it around his finger. He really needs to get rid of that habit – it’s a massive tell.</p><p>He draws a blank. What the <em>fuck</em> is he supposed to name a musical instrument? He doesn’t even play anything. Not even the <em>dizi</em>, which is a pretty Yunmeng instrument in and of itself, much less the <em>guqin</em>. That’s a purely Lan clan thing.</p><p>He’s just about to give up and tell Lan Xichen that this is a terrible idea – in fact, he’s opening his mouth to do that very thing – when a name pops fully-formed into his head. Without thinking, he blurts it out.</p><p>“<em>Yongwan</em>.”</p><p><em>Always smiling</em>.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s features spread into the same smile Jiang Cheng has named the <em>guqin</em> for. Not his usual one, the one he uses on everyone, the one that’s made him famous as the pacifist, the peacemaker. No; this is softer, special somehow. The one he reserves for things that make him truly happy.</p><p>“I like it,” he says. His fingers rest over the strings. And then he begins to play.</p>

          <p>Wow this chapter got finished quickly. I basically included the last part because the fandom gives JC a lot of grief for sucking at naming things, but personally, I don't think it's that bad. Yeah, as the fabulously talented @Hamliet pointed out in their amazing fic "Thank You, And I'm Sorry", the names of his dogs kind of sound like prostitutes' names, but he wasn't even ten when he named them. At least none of them were called 'Xiao Bai'.</p><p>(For everyone who doesn't speak Chinese, that means 'Little White'. It's the 'Lucky' of the Chinese world; it's the most generic name you can give your dog, rabbit, whatever. In primary school, everyone's dogs in compositions were named 'Xiao Bai', and our teachers were so fed up with it that they forbid us from using it ever again. For everyone who remembers the horrors of primary school compositions, I offer up this little gem: 'Xiao Ming'.)</p><p>That said, when JC got a little older, his naming skills got LOADS better. I mean, Sandu is the most badass name for a sword I've ever seen. (The Three Poisons, come on.) So, yeah. You're welcome to disagree in the comments below.</p><p>Today's song is 'Someone You Loved' by Lewis Capaldi.</p><p>Thanks everybody for reading, and I hope to see you next time.</p>

    <p>The cottage fills with the sound of music. Every note Lan Xichen’s hands pluck from the strings swells within the small space. The melody is simple and slow, but heart-aching all the same. It speaks of melancholy, of long days and nights waiting alone for something he isn’t sure will come.</p><p>It’s the kind of song that demands to be heard. But more than that, to be <em>listened</em> to. It reaches inside your chest and wraps around your soul, so tangible it hurts.</p><p>Jiang Cheng knows little about music – next to nothing, in fact – but what he does know is that Lan Xichen is very, very good. He was already familiar with that fact, of course, seeing as the talent of Gusu’s Twin Jades has ever been lauded as incomparable. But it is quite a different thing, hearing it for himself.</p><p>The notes taper off, high and sweet, scattering to the air like flower petals in the wind. The song ends. A hush descends over the room for a moment as the sound of it fades, and Jiang Cheng doesn’t even dare to speak.</p><p>Rare for him; yet there is a kind of magic in music well-played that cannot be explained away by golden cores and cultivation levels and <em>lingqi</em>. Jiang Cheng can’t use it – not for lack of trying – but he sure as hell can <em>feel</em> it.</p><p>Lan Xichen has woven a spell here, with just a few plucks of a few strings. It is nearly impossible to imagine what he could do with his own favoured instrument. His <em>xiao</em>, Liebing, which he no longer plays.</p><p>It is an incredible loss. But then who would hear it anyway, all the way up here, with Zewu-Jun behind closed doors in the middle of nowhere? No one would hear. No one would know. And so no one would care.</p><p>(<em>Cares</em>, perhaps. Present tense. After all, isn’t it true that no one <em>knows</em>?)</p><p>There is a lump in Jiang Cheng’s throat. He can’t tell whether it is from the music or something else. Perhaps he was wrong after all, he muses to himself, as the silence stretches long between them. He cares. For however much that is worth – or however little – Jiang Cheng cares.</p><p>(Then again, perhaps that is the same as saying it matters to no one at all.)</p><p>“What song was that?”, he asks in an effort to drag his thoughts away from the horrifyingly maudlin turn they’ve taken. His voice is still hushed, though, and he hates it more than a little, but he can’t bring himself to speak any louder.</p><p>Lan Xichen rubs at a nonexistent speck of dust on his <em>guqin</em>’s – Yongwan, since he’s apparently going with Jiang Cheng’s suggestion – mirror-polished surface.</p><p>“I wrote it. And no,” he adds, looking at Jiang Cheng with an indecipherable expression, “it doesn’t have a name either.”</p><p>Well, <em>that</em> raises a million and one questions, doesn’t it? When, why, what for, <em>how</em>, and so on – and probably not a single one appropriate. Who for, too, which might be the worst of the lot, but a question that circles in Jiang Cheng’s mind regardless, because if there’s anything he learned from hanging around Wei Wuxian during his older brother’s “artistic phases”, it’s that there’s always some sort of inspiration that goes along with creation. Usually in the form of another person.</p><p><em>It’s called a muse, little brother</em>, Wei Wuxian had said countless times as he wrote about this girl, or that girl who had caught his passing fancy. He thought himself in love with them in every poem that he wrote. Always a new poem, a new girl.</p><p>Then one day in Cloud Recesses he wrote five in a row about Lan Wangji’s smile – <em>rare as a white lotus in winter</em> (Jiang Cheng had had to excuse himself to go throw up) – and well, that was the end of that. Really, on hindsight, Jiang Cheng should have seen all this coming sooner.</p><p>But he’s getting off-topic. The point here is that people who create things draw inspiration from other people. People important to them. People– usually people they love. For some reason, the thought sparks a strange disquiet in Jiang Cheng. He can’t imagine why.</p><p>He already knew that Lan Xichen had harboured…romantic feelings for Chifeng-Zun before his untimely death, and he’d been as close as anything with his third sworn brother until the full extent of his machinations were revealed. Even though Jin Guang– <em>that man</em> was a piece of shit who, Jiang Cheng privately thinks, got what was coming to him, he was still Lan Xichen’s piece of shit. Familial connections, ties of affection between siblings and friends go a long way.</p><p>Thirteen years carrying a flute he couldn’t play. Of course Jiang Cheng would know.</p><p>He’s not jealous or anything, he tells himself resolutely. What is there to be jealous of? The answer is: absolutely nothing. He’s simply…confused, is all. Concerned for his friend’s wellbeing. Yes, that’s it.</p><p>“What’s it about?”, he asks. The song, he means. The sadness, the haunting melody like seeing ghosts around every corner and not knowing if they were figments of your imagination, or flesh-eating ghouls lying in wait. That had to come from somwhere, after all.</p><p>He keeps an eye trained on Lan Xichen’s fingers, watching for tension, for the knuckles going white with strain. He’ll back off if it comes to that – they’ve had too many close calls over the past two days for Jiang Cheng to be comfortable pushing his boundaries.</p><p>“I wrote it six months after I went into seclusion,” the other man replies. “It’s not <em>about</em> anything – it’s more a feeling than anything else.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks up, his eyes meeting Lan Xichen’s golden ones. There is pain there, and a gentle sort of sadness. Even in his grief, Lan Xichen is gentle. Beautiful.</p><p>“This isn’t the future I’d imagined for myself,” Lan Xichen says unexpectedly. His head dips as though studying his <em>guqin</em> intently, and the light coming in through the window casts his features in a golden glow. For the first time, Jiang Cheng notices that the other sect leader has a scar just above his eyebrow. Tiny and feather-white, an imperfection hidden amongst flawlessness. “When I was young, I mean. Still a child.”</p><p>“I thought I’d be married by now. With children, maybe, and Wangji would have found a nice, quiet boy from our sect who made him smile and didn’t mind how little he talks.”</p><p>His expression is longing, his eyes strangely misty. It’s easy for Jiang Cheng to imagine, that rosy never-there life. The inevitable this-will-be that the kid Lan Xichen had been had thought he’d have, long before everything went to hell.</p><p>“Rusong would be Sizhui’s age this year,” the older man says, and Jiang Cheng’s memory conjures up a hazy image of a five-year-old with a bright laugh, tugging on his father’s golden sleeve, always reaching for that stupid floppy hat. A small hand clutching Jin Ling’s even tinier fingers, slowing down for his baby cousin’s unsteady steps. “Mingjue probably would have had a son or daughter. And when the children were old enough, they’d all be sworn brothers and sisters, just like us.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng glances down again, at Lan Xichen’s fingers. They’re trembling. An urge takes him, hard and fast and sudden, to lay his hand over the other sect leader’s. He only barely manages to resist.</p><p>“This isn’t where any of us thought we would be,” he says instead. That, at least, is a safe statement. Jiang Cheng sure as fuck hadn’t expected to be leading his sect at seventeen after watching his parents murdered. Hadn’t factored in a life as a single parent to his orphaned nephew, either. “But we’re still here, aren’t we?”</p><p>He doesn’t know who that’s directed at: Lan Xichen or himself.</p><p>Truth is, Jiang Cheng has never put much thought into his future. Oh, he plans ahead, certainly – weeks, months, years, even <em>decades</em> – for the Jiang sect and the future of Yunmeng. But not his own. That sun-soaked life Lan Xichen is describing like a happy memory has never even entered his mind. He’s always been too busy just trying to make it from one day to the next. One foot in front of the other, crossing whole miles before he even thinks to look up.</p><p>But he remembers a game he and Wei Wuxian used to play. One of them would ask the other, “how do you think you’ll die?”, and the other had to answer. Like everything else, it was Wei Wuxian’s idea. They came up with increasingly outlandish scenarios for months before one of them inevitably got bored and they forgot about it.</p><p>Despite the ridiculous answers he gave back then, trying desperately to outdo his older brother’s much-lauded creativity, Jiang Cheng had, as a kid, always assumed he’d go in the most mundane way possible. Ideally, surrounded by friends and family, passing peacefully in his sleep.</p><p>The very thought seems ridiculous now. He doesn’t know the last time he had that fantasy. He doesn’t even know when it began to change.</p><p>Because now when Jiang Cheng thinks about his death, it isn’t soft or peaceful or sentimental. Just…going on a night hunt one day and not coming back. No one would mourn him, of that Jiang Cheng is certain. A few, maybe – Jin Ling and his brother – but none more. More than a couple assholes might even dance on his grave.</p><p>Funny how when he pictures it, he’s never any older. There are never any more lines on his face than there are now, than there have been since he was twenty years old.</p><p>“Yes, we’re still here,” Lan Xichen says. He’s still staring at his <em>guqin</em>, tracing patterns on the wood, and Jiang Cheng hears the words he isn’t saying as clearly as if he’d shouted them.</p><p><em>We’re still here, but they’re not</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t even have to ask who ‘they’ are. Everyone they’ve lost over the years – lost to war or hatred or scheming, or their own ignorance and pride. Their parents, brothers, sisters, friends. The people they used to be.</p><p><em>Do you ever</em>– It’s on the tip of Jiang Cheng’s tongue, but he swallows it back before it can escape. He doesn’t want to hear the answer to that question. He knows his own, of course. He knows what he would give not to be the last of his family, the last Jiang standing when the war was won and the dust cleared. Everything. <em>Everything.</em></p><p>(It wasn’t supposed to be him. His mother, father, sister, but not him. He doesn’t deserve it.)</p><p>“It’s not wrong, you know. That it’s you.” Jiang Cheng’s throat is dry. He doesn’t know where the words are coming from. Lan Xichen’s fingers still. “If– if it had to be anyone, I’m glad that it’s you.”</p><p>What is he even saying? This isn’t like him at all. This isn’t something Jiang Cheng does – he doesn’t just go around telling people <em>I’m glad that you’re alive</em>, or any of that sappy bullshit. That’s Wei Wuxian’s job. Jiang Cheng just sits down and shuts up and fights harder to make sure they stay that way.</p><p>“It scares me sometimes,” the other man replies, voice nearly a whisper. “It’s so very lonely without them. I have Wangji still, and Shu-Fu, but it’s hard to remember all the way up here.”</p><p>
  <em>When the memories rise up and pull you under, and the thin thread tying you to all you have left is barely anything against the weight of everything you’ve lost. Then eventually you choke on it all and somewhere in the struggle for air you forget to hold on and it slips out of your fingers, or you hold on too tight and it snaps, and you’re left sinking anyway. Drowning.</em>
</p><p>Yeah, Jiang Cheng knows the feeling. Knows it well enough to recognize the swell of the memories just before they come for him, well enough to know that the only way to escape the tide’s pull is to swim as fast and far as possible in the other direction, and pray that he makes it to the shore before it catches up.</p><p>(He works through the flashbacks, writes papers and papers and slashes open practice dummies by the dozens until his muscles burn enough to drive away the phantom chill of shackles on his skin. Until he’s breathing hard enough that the panting is exertion and not because he can’t fill his lungs for the panic.)</p><p>Lan Xichen hasn’t figured it out yet. He still thinks he can wait it out, or sort through his head somehow until everything’s right back in its proper position. He hasn’t yet realised that that’s not how it works; that the only way to keep feeling like everything’s fixed is to keep on working like nothing was ever broken.</p><p>You can run on a broken leg so long as you don’t <em>stop</em>. But you can’t lock yourself in a room with a tsunami and think you’ll ever be able to come out again.</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t know why he cares so much. Hell, maybe it’s just because he sees in Lan Xichen the same fucking problems that have made his life a shitshow since before he hit eighteen, and he wants – no, he <em>needs</em> – to believe that someone can make it out of this mess. If anyone can, it’s Lan Xichen. Jiang Cheng just needs to know it’s possible.</p><p>It’s not because he doesn’t know what he’ll do if Lan Xichen doesn’t make it. It’s definitely not because after all he’s lost, he can’t lose Lan Xichen too. Jiang Cheng’s heartless – everyone knows that. Jiang Cheng doesn’t think things like that.</p><p>“Then leave,” he says.</p><p>The words fly out of his mouth before he can even think about them. And <em>oh shit</em>, because it’s one thing to think that Lan Xichen needs to get out of this place before it sucks away the last dregs of his happiness – his fucking <em>will to live</em> – and completely another to say it out loud. That’s a line Jiang Cheng doesn’t get to cross.</p><p>Yet he hasn’t just crossed it. He’s obliterated it entirely.</p><p>His subconscious screams at him. <em>You fucking idiot!</em>, it shrieks. <em>You can’t say that! And now you can’t take it back! Just look what you’ve done; take a look at the aftermath of another one of your absolutely marvelous decisions. </em></p><p>But the words are still coming, and Jiang Cheng is powerless to stop them. “Why are you still here, then, if it makes you so miserable?”</p><p>This is nothing like Jiang Cheng’s ever done before. It’s not the first time he’s ever lost control of himself – far from it – but it’s never been like this. There’s no red haze, no all-consuming anger, no desire to maim or maul. Just questions that won’t stop coming, and a growing sense of horror.</p><p>Across from him, Lan Xichen has begun to shake. When Jiang Cheng chances a glance at his face, all the colour has gone out of it, like a faded robe washed too many times.</p><p>“You wouldn’t understand.” The reply sounds jagged, like it’s being clawed out of him. For all Jiang Cheng knows, it might be.</p><p>It strikes at something deep in his chest, something a little too close to where his core sits bright and burning and just right, but somehow always <em>wrong</em>. Right underneath his ribs, where he’s still seventeen and his father is telling him <em>you don’t understand</em>.</p><p>Why would he, Jiang Cheng thinks, not expecting an answer. He never has before. That’s what everyone says. Angry as all hell and too fucking bitter to live – that’s him; no room for guilt or regret or any of the emotions you have to show to convince everyone else there’s an actual person under there.</p><p>He knows Lan Xichen doesn’t mean it like that. Doesn’t mean for it to hurt, of course. Lan Xichen never wants to hurt anyone, and that’s his problem, really. He’d be so much better off if he didn’t care. But it stings. <em>Gods</em>, does it sting.</p><p>“Maybe I would.” Chin up, back stiff, look straight ahead. Ah-Niang’s voice rings in his ear. “Try me.”</p><p>This is unbelievable. They’d been getting along so well, and now Jiang Cheng’s gearing up for a fight. Typical. He ruins everything he touches, as per usual. And Lan Xichen…</p><p>Lan Xichen is staring at him, white-faced and trembling. He looks like he might cry again, but his jaw is set. Good. At least he’s standing up for himself. Even if it is against Jiang Cheng.</p><p>“I’ve told you: I can’t leave. It’s not because I don’t want to, because I do. Believe me, I want more than anything to be able to leave this place. I want to be able to get it together enough to go back outside.” He’s breathing harder now, voice growing stronger with every word. He’ll be shouting soon, if he keeps it up. “But look at me.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng hasn’t so much as glanced anywhere else for the past ten minutes.</p><p>“<em>Look</em> at me, Wanyin,” the older man says again. The colour is creeping back into his cheeks. “I’m a mess. Do you remember yesterday? How long it took me just to gather up the courage to step outside? I can’t even speak to anyone outside of my family anymore without panicking.”</p><p><em>You’re talking to me</em>, Jiang Cheng wants to say. But doesn’t, because this is very obviously not what calm is supposed to look like. Following that, he remembers the numerous times over the past few days where something he’s said or done has sent Lan Xichen off the edge, and is very glad that for once, he’s managed to keep his damn mouth shut.</p><p>And then Lan Xichen says something that turns his entire world upside down.</p><p>“The world– I don’t belong out there. There’s no place for me in it anymore.”</p><p>There are twin spots of pink high in his cheeks, his eyes are shining with unshed tears, and every word strikes true. These are his thoughts, raw and unvarnished. This is what he really believes, with all his heart. He’s ripped his chest to shreds to bare his soul, and for the first time, Jiang Cheng sees it for the wreck it is. Tattered and torn. <em>Giving up</em>.</p><p>It fills him with anger. Not righteous anger – there’s no cause he’s championing, no monster to slay or demon to send right back to the depths of hell. Only a man. A man he’s always thought perfect, even in his little imperfections; flawless. Better, somehow. But now the rose-coloured fog has lifted from his eyes, and Jiang Cheng sees someone broken and battered, giving in because he can’t bear to fight any longer.</p><p>He should be disgusted. After all, Jiang Cheng has always fought, even when it was hopeless – isn’t that the motto of his sect? Yet the anger welling up in him is clean. As untainted as he’s ever felt.</p><p>It’s not weakness that he sees in Lan Xichen, but something else. Something he can’t put a name to.</p><p>“That’s the biggest load of horseshit I’ve ever heard.” Pain flares in Jiang Cheng’s right hand, and he realises his nails are digging into his palm hard enough to draw blood. It grounds him. “There’s <em>always</em> somewhere to go. You think there was a place for all of us, after the war? Or during, before all the sects got our collective shit together? I don’t know if you remember this, but there wasn’t. We made one.”</p><p>“I told you, I don’t belong–”</p><p>“Yunmeng isn’t even supposed to <em>exist</em> anymore, Xichen.” It feels like tearing something out of himself to admit it, but the other man needs to hear this. More than that, it needs to be said. And who but Jiang Cheng will say it? “Maybe you’ve forgotten, but I haven’t. The others – <em>Jin Guangshan</em> – wanted to strike us from the annals, give our territory to my mother’s clan. Well, fuck that.”</p><p>“And Nie Huaisang,” he adds, before Lan Xichen can get a word in edgewise. “I don’t like him, but then nobody does. He doesn’t belong. Most of the Nies are mad with battlelust half the time, can barely see past the ends of their <em>dao</em> the rest of it; and there he is, with his fans and his plots and schemes and little tricks no one else sees coming. But you know what? He’s still here, and he’s not going anywhere.”</p><p>By the time Jiang Cheng pauses to draw a breath, there is silence from the only other person in the room. Lan Xichen is struck dumb, mouth slack with shock. Jiang Cheng is crossing all the lines here, telling Lan Xichen these things. But they’re the truth. Pure and unvarnished, the same as Lan Xichen told him only a few moments ago.</p><p>He deserves that respect. Lan Xichen deserves it and more, but this is all Jiang Cheng can give him. He hopes it is enough. (Knowing Jiang Cheng, it won’t be. It’s never enough.)</p><p>“So don’t tell me that there’s no place for you and expect me to believe it. You want help making one, I’ll help. I’ll keep you updated on everything you’ve missed since you’ve been gone. I’ll leave Lotus Pier open for you if you need it. I’ll whip your whole Council’s ass with Zidian if I have to.”</p><p>After that torrent of words, Jiang Cheng struggles to find the next ones to continue. But he forges on ahead anyway, because even if he fucks this up, he’ll have tried.</p><p>“But just– just stop hiding, Xichen. You don’t need to.”</p>

    <p>The words crash over Lan Huan with all the strength of a hurricane.</p><p><em>You don’t need to hide</em>. The younger man says it with such vehemence, such sincerity and utter belief, as though he can make it true through the force of his will alone. Lan Huan almost believes him, because if anyone can accomplish such a thing, it’s Jiang Wanyin.</p><p>It sparks something like relief in him, even as a maelstrom of other emotions swirls through his chest. Guilt, disgust, self-loathing. It burns him to admit how low he’s sunk. Lan Huan has never been prideful – that’s another one of the myriad things prohibited in the Cloud Recesses – but he’s always striven to keep some basic modicum of self-respect.</p><p>This, now, is shameful. Humiliating. So broken he can barely leave his tiny cottage, can’t bring himself to brave the outside world as an inhabitant rather than an infrequent visitor, and he can’t even deny it. He’s admitted to it in front of someone else; not just <em>anyone</em>, but another sect leader.</p><p>Lan Huan was fully prepared for censure, for revulsion to creep into the other man’s voice the same way it had into Mingjue’s whenever he so much as mentioned Guangyao. Jiang Wanyin – much like his elder brother was – is a man who respects strength. Abhors weakness, too, and Lan Huan has confessed to the very worst kind of all: cowardice. Giving in to his own fear.</p><p>Then the other man began his tirade, and Lan Huan couldn’t help the way his shoulders hunched inwards, vainly trying to soften the inevitable blow. <em>This is it</em>, he’d thought, as Jiang Wanyin sat there and tore apart his words. <em>It’s obvious, isn’t it; this is why I can’t – shouldn’t – have friends. It always falls apart sooner or later</em>.</p><p>It just happened to be sooner this time.</p><p>But that wasn’t the point at all. No; even as he rejected Lan Huan’s statement, he didn’t reject Lan Huan himself. He offered–</p><p>
  <em>There’s always somewhere to go.</em>
</p><p><em>You want help making one, I’ll help</em>.</p><p>A lump grows in Lan Huan’s throat, pressing on his airways. Following that dramatic declaration, the younger man’s eyes bore into his own, frighteningly intense. So dark they’re nearly black, crackling like lightning in his narrow face. There is no deception there, nothing but fierce determination.</p><p>And for what? To help <em>him</em>?</p><p>He cares, Lan Huan realises, like a crack of thunder on a cloudless day. For some reason, he cares about Lan Huan, doesn’t want him locked away in seclusion for the rest of his life. He wants him to leave, to go back into the world, to fight and carve out a place for himself anew so that he can belong somewhere again. To be brave.</p><p>And Lan Huan <em>wants</em>. He wants to be brave for Jiang Wanyin, because of the faith he can see in the younger sect leader’s eyes, the pure conviction written in the lines of his face. The others…they all look at him with resignation. Solemn acceptance and thinly-veiled disappointment. Even Wangji, for all that he loves his brother, must wish that he were stronger.</p><p>Yet Jiang Wanyin is the only one who says it. The only one who breaks every rule of propriety and common courtesy to challenge him, to dare him to <em>try</em>.</p><p>(Lan Huan falls a little bit deeper in love with the sharpness of his tongue and the fire in his heart.)</p><p>His eyes feel damp, and he blinks back the tears before they can roll down his cheeks. Lays his hand over his face, just for a moment, so the other man won’t see him struggling for control, and uses it to wipe away the lingering wetness around his eyes.</p><p>“I–” he chokes out at last, his voice thick – “I don’t know what to say to that.”</p><p>To his surprise, Jiang Wanyin’s mouth curves into a small smile. He reaches out and lays a hand over Lan Huan’s, now half-tangled in the strings of his <em>guqin</em>. Lan Huan’s brain stutters to a stop.</p><p>“Just say that when you get out of here, you’ll come see me for a change.”</p><p>What can Lan Huan do but nod and promise him that? Such a small thing, when it’s becoming harder to deny that he would give Jiang Wanyin anything he asks for. Anything at all. It terrifies him.</p><p>“And…thank you,” he says, once he’s gathered up the courage to speak the words.</p><p>The younger sect leader looks taken aback, and Lan Huan’s chest aches a little, because when was the last time someone thanked this man? Probably a long, long time ago, if his reaction is anything to go by. Lan Huan needs to do it more often.</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“Everything,” he breathes. Jiang Wanyin’s mouth parts in surprise and Lan Huan shocks himself with how much he wants to kiss him. He dips his head, hiding the ugly flush he’s sure has overtaken his face. “What you said – about leaving – I’ll…I’ll try.”</p><p>“Then that’s enough.” The response is so earnest, and everything Lan Huan’s never known he needed to hear. <em>You’re enough</em>. It makes his head feel light.</p><p>He could do it, he really could. He could walk out that door right now, go back out into the Cloud Recesses proper and tell Shu-Fu he’s ready to come home. He’s been able to all this time. And though the thought of returning to society still fills him with trepidation, it’s less this time. Less than a year ago, a month ago. Less than yesterday.</p><p><em>Soon</em>, he tells himself. The word rings of truth.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>That night, Lan Huan has a very confusing dream.</p><p>
  <em>He is alone in a very long hallway – so long he cannot see the two ends of it. It is near completely dark: there are no torches or sconces, only the single candle Lan Huan is holding, the wick already halfway burned down. Though the air is still, the flame flickers and jumps, casting pitch-black shadows that writhe across the floor.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Footsteps sound to his left. Lan Huan whirls around. The light from his single pitiful candle barely reaches three feet away; still, he can see the shine of eyes in the dark. Then the other person finally comes into view.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Tall. That’s the first thing Lan Huan registers. Large and hulking, his shoulders even broader than Lan Huan’s, the top of his head nearly scraping the low ceiling. Then his profile: thick eyebrows and a hawk-like nose.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s Mingjue. His elder brother.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Mingjue-xiong,” he says. This is a dream; he knows it. It must be.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The other man raises his head, and Lan Huan is surprised by how young he looks. Barely twenty-five, just as he had the last time Lan Huan saw him. It’s Lan Huan who’s older now.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Ah-Huan.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>And that’s the moment Lan Huan’s heart shatters into little tiny pieces. Of course this is a dream. Mingjue never called him that, even when he asked. When they were both young and foolish, and thought they had all their lives ahead of them. To hear it now, after everything…</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He knows he should turn away. The past has no business haunting him still, is what Shu-Fu would say. But it’s been so long, and Lan Huan has always been weaker than he should be.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>So he stays. Holds still when Mingjue reaches out, brushes his cheek with his fingers. The touch is cold.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Before his eyes, Mingjue’s skin pales to bone-white. Black veins creep out from his collar, up his neck, blooming like thorns across his face. Through it all, his hand stays flattened against Lan Huan’s cheek. There is so much brute strength in those fingers. Lan Huan once saw him snap the wrist of a cultivator who had called Huaisang useless just like that, the bone giving way like rotting wood. But Mingjue doesn’t so much as twitch.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lan Huan finds that he can’t move.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I’m sorry, Dage,” he whispers. “I’m so sorry.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Let go, Ah-Huan. You have to let me go.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>He wants to protest that Mingjue is the one holding on to him; but he isn’t, not really.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“I didn’t see – I should have seen– I’m so sorry, I failed you.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“None of that,” the other man tells him. Stern but gentle – Lan Huan can see it, even though his eyes are now red and glowing like a fierce corpse’s. It’s still Mingjue. It’s only a dream, but it’s still Mingjue. It feels so real. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>“It’s time for me to go, Ah-Huan.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“No, please–” He’s begging, he knows, but desperation fills his chest. His older brother can’t leave him, not like this. Because somehow, Lan Huan knows that this dream will be the last time he ever sees Mingjue. “I miss you. I don’t want to forget what you look like. I don’t want to forget the way your voice sounds.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>In his dreams, Lan Huan speaks his thoughts. He says what he would never dare to say out loud in the real world. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Mingjue’s grim face melts into a sad smile.”You won’t.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You can’t know that.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“You won’t,” he says again. His hand falls from Lan Huan’s cheek. “You need to leave, Er-di. Go back out into the real world.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Dage–”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lan Huan tries to protest, but Mingjue shushes him with a look. The same look he’d give when Lan Huan was doing something frustrating, or trying to get him to talk to people. Sometimes they were one and the same.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>“Take care of Huaisang for me.”</em>
</p><p>
  <em>With that, he turns away. Lan Huan almost cries out, but his voice fails as Mingjue’s long legs carry him back into the dark. And all around him, the shadows begin to dance more wildly than before. Reaching towards him, leaping and flickering as they encroach on his tiny circle of light.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>For the first time in a while, Lan Huan looks down at his little candle. The flame has burned almost all the way down the wick by now. The wax, clear and running, fills the dish to the brim. As he watches, the single bright point of light reaches the liquid and disappears, leaving him in total darkness.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>The wax overflows. It spills across his hands, warm and scorching, solidifying where it touches his skin. He holds on tighter, tighter, even as his mind tells him to let go…</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>He wakes up with his heart pounding, hands tingling with the phantom heat of the wax from his dream. Outside, the sky is dark, but only as it is at five in the morning. He’s slept through the night.</p><p>Rare for him, and even rarer on a night like this. Where dreams steal into his sleep, digging up faces from long ago. His heart feels hollow, though, as though something has been scooped out of it, leaving only an empty space where that something used to be.</p><p>Mingjue is gone. That, at least, he is sure of. Lan Huan will never see him again, not even in his nightmares. That used to be the only thing that made them bearable. Getting to see him again. To see Guangyao again, his mother and father, all those he has lost. And now one of their number is gone from his dreams, and still absent from his life.</p><p>Suddenly, powerfully, Lan Huan longs to be held. For someone to hold him, the way he so often held Wangji when he was little and struggling to sleep. Or even someone <em>to</em> hold, to cling onto him, curled tight around him like a warm blanket.</p><p>He wants someone to tell him everything will be all right. The trouble is, he’s not sure he can be all right.</p><p><em>There’s always somewhere to go</em>, Lan Huan hears again, Jiang Wanyin’s voice echoing inside his head. It eases the longing somewhat, like a candle holding the dark at bay, just like the one in his dream. Fragile and all-too-easily extinguished.</p><p>He prays it won’t go out.</p>

          <p>Holy crap this has reached 1001 comments. Like WHAT????!!! I can't even believe it this is so awesome I love you guys so much. Your comments make my day; really they do. Thank you all for sticking with this story so far.</p><p>On a side note, I've received a couple reviews in the comments section saying that this is a bit 啰嗦 and ridiculously long. So, yeah, I'm sorry about that. As I've said, I'm a teenager and a novice writer (and no Christopher Paolini) so I'm not entirely sure what the expected quality of this is supposed to be. But thank you for your feedback - I'm trying to be more concise. It's just so hard.<br/>For those of you wondering when the slow burn will finally - FINALLY - turn into an actual thing, I think I'll have it done by chapter seventy at least. Before that happens, some stuff will definitely go down, so stay tuned :)</p><p>Today's songs are 'One by One' and 'Stigmatised' by The Calling. I also have another story idea (yay), so you can read that too if you want:</p><p>Years after the events of the novel, LXC has finally come out of seclusion, and his first cultivation conference is going to be held at Cloud Recesses. By this time, JL is a man grown and pretty stable as the leader of the Jin sect. Nonetheless, he maintains a close relationship with both his uncles - it's that that clues him in that JC really, really doesn't want to go to Gusu. In fact, now that JL thinks about it, JC has been pretty determined to avoid the Cloud Recesses entirely since the Guanyin Temple debacle, which is both strange and puzzling.<br/>JL - and his buddies LSZ and LJY - decide to get to the bottom of this the only way they know how - by snooping. What they find is something absolutely no one saw coming. <br/>Here's the tea: back when JC and LXC were roaming the countryside assembling an army, they actually spent a good bit of time alone together, and thus fell into a sort of quasi-relationship. After the war was over, a series of misunderstandings led to them falling apart and convinced the other wasn't actually interested, and they've been pining ever since. <br/>Cue all the good stuff, the junior trio cracking their skulls to get their idiot uncles together before the awkwardness kills them all, and WWX dragging LWJ into this whole mess because his burning curiosity is forcing him to find out what the kids are up to. Bonus points for LXC feeling really guilty because JC was really young (17 to his 21 - and oh yeah, JL can kind of see where he's coming from there because *whoa* that's young) and he felt like he was taking advantage of him, as well as JC thinking his inadequacies make him unlovable. You know, the usual.</p><p>I'm kind of into that idea, so we'll see how that goes. Please let me know in the comments below (gosh I sound like a Youtuber), and thanks so much for reading. Have a great day!!!</p>

    <p>The next day, Jiang Cheng seeks out Lan Xichen in his little cottage. For hours, they discuss Jin Ling’s lesson plans, and Jiang Cheng can almost forget the pain in his chest that flared to life when his nephew first announced his desire to remain in Cloud Recesses. Lan Xichen looks better today – at least more than he did yesterday – which isn’t saying much, really, because he may not have cried but he sure got pretty fucking close.</p><p>They make plans and go over details; Jiang Cheng amends the lesson schedule they’ve worked out three times before he’s finally satisfied. (Lan Xichen just crosses his arms and struggles not to laugh at him, the bastard.) He makes arrangements for Jin Ling to share a dormitory with the other disciples – because the brat needs to learn some social skills, damnit, it’s a wonder he’s managed to make two friends as it is – and talks the other sect leader into agreeing to give Jin Ling one-on-one lessons on leadership.</p><p>He knows what he must look like to everyone else: paranoid, obsessive. Over-protectiveness is the least offensive of the traits he could be accused of having. He’s a frenzied mess right now, needing everything to be absolutely perfect, down to the last detail.</p><p>But this is Jin Ling. Ah-Jie’s little boy. The child Jiang Cheng has raised on his own since he was barely more than one himself. The brat is growing up, he’s <em>leaving</em>, and if this is one of the last things Jiang Cheng will ever get to do for him, then it’ll damn well be perfect. Or at least, as close as he can get it.</p><p>At some point, Jiang Cheng looks up at the clock and discovers it’s already late afternoon. He arrived here more or less at mid-morning, and the discussion has been going on since then, uninterrupted for hours. A quick inspection of the other sect leader shows that Lan Xichen is as poised and composed as ever, but Jiang Cheng knows that his discomfort is often hidden, and the both of them are about due for a break anyway.</p><p>“That’s enough for today,” he says quietly when Lan Xichen reaches again for the teapot that Jiang Cheng already knows is empty. The other man gets to his feet with an audible sigh, supporting most of his weight on one leg. At Jiang Cheng’s quizzical look, he sighs again.</p><p>“Pins and needles,” he explains. “I can’t feel my right foot.”</p><p>There’s a light dusting of pink on his cheeks like he’s embarrassed, and Jiang Cheng chuckles for a second before standing as well. He, too, nearly falls over as the blood rushes back into his legs. It’s Lan Xichen’s turn to laugh at him, and Jiang Cheng pulls a face.</p><p>“I’m not made to sit still that long.”</p><p>“Oh, stop complaining,” Lan Xichen shoots back, comfortably teasing. “This was your idea in the first place.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng can’t think of a good answer to that. He settles for a grumpy “shut up, old man,” and immediately knows it was the right choice when Lan Xichen lets out a sound of amusement.</p><p>“I’m only four years older than you,” he points out. “Hardly on my death bed yet.”</p><p>Then his expression sobers. He looks right into Jiang Cheng’s eyes and says, “I’ve been thinking about what you said yesterday.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng said a great many things yesterday. He’s not quite sure which one. The puzzlement must show on his face, because Lan Xichen takes a deep breath.</p><p>“About me leaving here,” he clarifies, tilting his head to glance out the window. The sun is lowering itself towards the horizon, casting the peonies just outside in a golden glow.</p><p>Jiang Cheng tenses. Truly, yesterday was not his proudest moment. Calling the older sect leader out on his self-isolation, going up in arms about <em>places </em>and <em>belonging</em> (like he knows so much about that), practically giving a speech… Yes, definitely not his proudest moment. Jiang Cheng’s no good at speeches.</p><p>“And?”, he asks, when no further words are forthcoming.</p><p>Lan Xichen hesitates, as if choosing his words slowly. Carefully.</p><p>“I will,” he finally says. “I’m going back at the end of the week.” His back straightens, squaring his shoulders like he’s steeling himself for something.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I– I need a little more time. Just a few more days, to figure a few things out.”</p><p>He shuts his eyes tightly. Jiang Cheng’s brow furrows.</p><p>“That’s not what I was asking,” he says, gentling his voice as much as he knows how. “I was asking about your decision. The reasons for it.”</p><p>“Oh,” says Lan Xichen, eyes suddenly open again, wide and blinking. The sun catches them and turns them the exact shade of the honey sold in the marketplace in Lotus Pier. “My reasons.”</p><p>“I’ve neglected my duties for long enough, don’t you think? I can hardly call myself a sect leader if I don’t, well, lead my sect.” He’s trying for levity, Jiang Cheng can tell. He’s <em>afraid</em> of this decision, much as he was yesterday. What Jiang Cheng doesn’t get is why he’s choosing now to make it.</p><p>His incomprehension must show on his face, because all the air abruptly goes out of Lan Xichen. It’s like a switch has been flipped; the open expression on his face shutters, and his shoulders curve inwards slightly. So slightly that his posture barely changes, but Jiang Cheng hasn’t been spending nearly all his free time for a week watching Lan Xichen for nothing, and so for him, the tiny shift is louder than a scream.</p><p>There’s no way his gods-awful speech yesterday prompted this kind of reaction. Absolutely no way.</p><p>“I had a dream last night,” the other man confesses. Of course. Yet there’s no curl of satisfaction in Jiang Cheng’s stomach at the confirmation that he was right. Just a strange sort of sinking feeling that’s almost hollow.</p><p>“I saw…someone I lost a long time ago. And he told me –” Lan Xichen cuts himself off. Then breathes deep and starts again. “I realised that it’s time for me to move on.”</p><p>Even without him mentioning it, Jiang Cheng can hazard a guess at who Lan Xichen’s mysterious dream-figure was. He doesn’t feel angered by it, he tells himself, or disappointed. Or anything at all, really, other than relief. This is Lan Xichen’s choice to make. And he’s glad of it, because the other man deserves to leave this place. But despite everything he said yesterday, he can’t help poking at it.</p><p>“Is this your decision?”, he asks. Then, unable to stop himself, he adds, “or his?”</p><p>Opposite him, the older sect leader goes still. Jiang Cheng can see him warring with himself, the conflict in his eyes, and wants to kick himself for the question.</p><p>“Does it matter?”, Lan Xichen asks in reply, the sound of something broken in his voice. “As long as I do it, does it matter whose decision it is?”</p><p>“Maybe not to anyone else, but it will to you. You’ll know.” <em>And that does matter</em>.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re returning to your position,” Jiang Cheng says unexpectedly. “But only if it’s because you want to.”</p><p>There’s a sharp intake of breath from the other man, so sharp it’s almost a hiss. His reply, when it comes, is quiet, and Jiang Cheng nearly has to strain himself to hear it.</p><p>“I do want to. I don’t– I don’t want to be my father.”</p><p>Lan Xichen hangs his head. Jiang Cheng can see what such a simple admission has cost him. Its weight in shame and guilt. It twists something in his chest, because Jiang Cheng understands. The shame is his own as well; the guilt too. For as much as he admires his Ah-Die, as much as he tries every day to be the kind of sect leader Jiang Fengmian would have wanted him to be, he doesn’t want to be his father either. Not in any of the ways that count.</p><p>Even with Jin Ling, he emulates his mother’s parenting. Her high expectations, her harsh punishments when he fell short, her sharp words and cutting tongue. And maybe that means Jin Ling believes his uncle doesn’t like him very much, but Jiang Cheng would rather die than make the kid think he doesn’t <em>love </em>him.</p><p>For Lan Xichen, it’s completely different and yet exactly the same. The older man is no fool – Jiang Cheng would wager half his sect’s gold that Lan Xichen has always known exactly what rumours circulate about his family line. Father and son both.</p><p>(He doesn’t know much about Lan Xichen’s mother, but there’s enough hearsay for him to figure out that whatever happened to her, it was nothing good.)</p><p>“You’re no coward, Lan Xichen.” The words burst out of him without warning. And even as Jiang Cheng curses his lack of control over his own mouth, a tiny part of him is glad of it, because it’s the truth. More than that, though, it’s the truth that Lan Xichen needs to hear.</p><p>The other man looks away. “So that <em>is</em> what they’re saying about me these days. I’d guessed, but I didn’t know for sure.”</p><p>It’s the closest to bitter Jiang Cheng’s ever heard him. A smile curves his lips, but it’s a twisted mockery of the one he usually wears. Something in Jiang Cheng’s chest clenches painfully at the sight. Lan Xichen is beautiful, always, especially when he’s smiling, but not like this. Never like this.</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t know what to say to that. It stands to reason; he’s never been good with his words anyway.</p><p>“Let them talk,” he says eventually. “They’re in no position to judge what they can’t understand.”</p><p>Lan Xichen’s gaze drifts back towards him. The smile on his face turns melancholic. “And do you judge, Wanyin? Do you think me spineless? Pathetic? Unable to move on?”</p><p>Though his words are accusatory, his tone is anything but. They sound, to Jiang Cheng, as though they are meant not for him but for Lan Xichen himself, listing weaknesses to convince himself of his own worthlessness.</p><p>“Whether or not I judge you and your decisions is not something you should care about.”</p><p>“Why?”, Lan Xichen asks in response. “Because you don’t understand? I think that out of all the people I’ve ever met, you would understand the best.”</p><p>There’s something there, hidden beneath the surface of Lan Xichen’s reply, but Jiang Cheng can’t see it. Yet he can make out the faint shape of it, like the dark silhouette of a water ghoul deep under a lake. It’s big. Very big. A lump grows in Jiang Cheng’s throat.</p><p>“If you leave – <em>when</em> you leave,” he manages, “it needs to be on your own terms. Not mine, or your uncle’s, or anyone else’s. Yours.”</p><p>“But yesterday… why?”</p><p>It’s nearly incoherent, but Jiang Cheng gets the gist of the question anyway. Lan Xichen is looking at him like he holds the answers to all the questions in the universe, like if he can just answer this one everything will be okay again. Jiang Cheng aches to tell him that’s not the case.</p><p>“You needed to see. It’s a choice you have to make –” here, Jiang Cheng pauses. When he finds his voice again, he continues: “you do need to make it. But when you do, it needs to be your decision.”</p><p>He knows it sounds ridiculous, the logic convoluted and nonsensical – even contradictory – but it’s the best he can do. And when Lan Xichen nods, he knows that the other man has heard what he’s been trying to say.</p><p>“Thank you,” is his answer. Jiang Cheng’s eyes follow the bob of his throat as he swallows. “I…I think I understand.”</p><p>It is so, so tempting to ask him if he means it, if he’s going to leave or stay – it’s all a mess, confusing and jumbled-up inside of Jiang Cheng’s head, but he keeps his mouth shut. He’s said enough on the subject as it is. Whatever Lan Xichen does next is up to him.</p><p>“Good,” he replies.</p><p>(That doesn’t mean Jiang Cheng doesn’t have a preferred outcome.)</p>

          <p>This chapter was a little bit of a filler, but I thought it was necessary because as I've said in the summary, the decision to leave seclusion is a very big one for LXC. He's been isolated for a whole year, and rejoining society shouldn't just be a snap decision for him - or at least, it should be one he makes on his own terms, and not at the behest of someone else (especially not a dude in a dream). Don't worry - he's still going to stick to his original decision to leave at the end of the week; I just wanted to have him think a little about making his own decisions rather than having to follow someone else's.</p><p>Today's song is 'Silent All These Years' by Tori Amos.</p><p>Next chapter is where secrets are revealed, stuff gets real, and I try to see how miserable I can make Jiang Cheng before I start to feel bad. This next bit is probably going to take quite a few chapters to get done, but I think it's a big part of the story and a very important loose thread that wasn't really tied up in the original novel (which is all to the good here, as I now get to play with it). So please bear with me here, and I hope you all have been enjoying yourselves thus far!!!! :)</p>

    <p>The sun has begun to set by the time Jiang Cheng finally leaves the little cottage. As always, Lan Xichen walks him to the edge of it, gaze lingering on his back as Jiang Cheng turns and disappears into the maze of corridors that lead back to the main buildings of the Cloud Recesses.</p><p>On the way back, he thinks about all they have discussed. By now, he’s gone over Lan Xichen’s words to him in his head nearly ten times. It’s giving him a headache, and so he turns his thoughts over to the conversation they had in the morning. His entire reason for still being on this damn mountain, in fact.</p><p>Truth be told, organising Jin Ling’s education here is harder than he thought it was going to be. Lan Xichen might be the most cooperative, <em>nicest</em> soul in the world, but that doesn’t change the fact that while Jiang Cheng has thought about sending his brat of a nephew here to study in the past, he’s never actually planned for it.</p><p>And Jiang Cheng…is not good with things he doesn’t plan for. They stress him out. Which is rather unfortunate, because all that life has thrown at him thus far has been things he most emphatically did not see coming. He really ought to be better at dealing with them.</p><p>Still, the fact remains that while Jin Ling is staying in this school, he damn well better learn something. It’s been some years since Jiang Cheng was a student here himself – he vaguely recalls sitting through Lan Qiren’s lectures on the different ways to dispose of various monsters and demons – and though he’s retained most of the information he learned back then, it’s all sort of been internalised to the point where he doesn’t really think about it before he uses it. Which is good in a fight, but it makes him next to useless as a teacher, and only marginally more useful when it comes to designing lesson plans.</p><p>He turns down another one of the winding corridors, heading to a part of the complex he hasn’t been in since his own school days. The Cloud Recesses boasts an impressive library – the largest collection of books in the world, in fact – which makes sense, given the general scholarly nature of its inhabitants.</p><p>Jiang Cheng recalls the shelves that line Lan Xichen’s living room wall, and the slight sagging of the wood under the weight of all the books it holds. Of <em>course</em> they’re all big readers.</p><p>Personally, Jiang Cheng isn’t one. Mostly, he just doesn’t have the time. When he does, well, reading has never been very enjoyable for him. It carries too many associations from his teen years, where if he wasn’t holding his sword it was a book in his hand instead, flipping through the pages, committing whole chunks of it to memory in the hope that maybe – just maybe – it would be enough. Enough to help him do decently on Lan Qiren’s next test, enough to show his father that <em>look, Ah-Die, I’m working hard. I’m doing what you want. I’m being good.</em></p><p>Yeah. He’d rather not relive that feeling, thank you very much.</p><p>Still, necessity calls, and Jiang Cheng can crack open a damn book just fine when he wants to. The Cloud Recesses library is massive – he can find a couple scrolls about zombie-slaying techniques. No problem.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes – and at least fifteen scrolls – later, Jiang Cheng revises his previous statement: it’s a huge fucking problem.</p><p>Not with finding information. No, that bit’s easy. In fact, the issue is that it’s <em>too </em>easy. There are so many goddamn books lying around that it’s like looking through a haystack to find a specific piece of hay rather than a needle.</p><p>He looks down at where his finger has come to rest on another book – something or other about <em>Cultivation Techniques for Intermediates</em> (the Lans are fucking terrible at naming, is what he’s discovered in the past half hour of browsing through the life’s work of a good number of their ancestors) – pulls it off the shelf, cracks it open, and sighs.</p><p><em>Useless</em>. Half the stuff in here, Jin Ling already knows. The other half, even Jiang Cheng doesn’t know. It’s the same with most of the other books he’s come across thus far. They’re all either full of basic information that most thirteen-year-old disciples have already mastered, or spouting the most obscure shit Jiang Cheng has never heard of in his life. Or, in the case of this particular scroll, an odd mixture of both.</p><p>He puts it back. Then he glances down again at the pile of books in his arms, considers for a moment, and puts it all back.</p><p>(Okay, maybe his time here hasn’t been <em>completely</em> ill-spent. He’s got a better idea of what his nephew needs to learn than he did half an hour ago. But still, he can’t help feeling like this was a waste of time.)</p><p>Jiang Cheng sighs again. At this hour, the library is completely empty. All the disciples are usually eating in the mess hall if he remembers correctly. Sometime in the next few minutes, he’s supposed to meet with Jin Ling for dinner as well.</p><p>He’d better go, then. The kid will pitch a fit if he’s late. Not, of course, that Jiang Cheng will let him get away with that, with Jin Ling’s recent misadventure at the cold springs so fresh in his mind. But Jiang Cheng has to set an example.</p><p><em>Just one more book</em>, he thinks. He’ll just check one more, and then he’ll go.</p><p>It’s a familiar decision; he can’t count all the times he skipped meals to study or train on his own as a teenager. That stopped after the first few months of their stay in Cloud Recesses, though. With him and Wei Wuxian practically living out of each other’s pockets, his brother noticed after the second time Jiang Cheng passed out in the practice yard after-hours, and quickly put an end to that.</p><p>Jiang Cheng scans the titles of the books in front of him. That one there – <em>General Tactics To Relieve Possession</em> – looks promising. He sort of remembers Lan Qiren mentioning something like that in class one day. Or perhaps he was talking about demonic cultivation.</p><p>He considers for a moment, then shrugs and reaches for the book anyway. There’s always tomorrow.</p><p>The book is difficult to pull out. Everything on the ridiculously long shelf is packed so tightly together that it’s nigh impossible to remove any one thing without sending the rest of them toppling. Jiang Cheng gives it a go anyway and tugs on the spine.</p><p>The corner slides free, and for a moment it looks like there won’t be a problem at all. Until something catches, there’s a bit of resistance, and then suddenly Jiang Cheng’s effort to overcome it sends half the contents of the shelf sprawling across the floor.</p><p>There are books everywhere. Some lying half-open, others at least conveniently closed, thank the gods, and somehow, one of them has ended up underneath another shelf entirely, face-down and open.</p><p>“<em>Fuck!</em>”, he swears explosively, and is glad that there is no one around to hear him when the sound echoes in the enclosed space. <em>Good fucking job</em>, he remarks to himself, before bending down to pick up the mess he’s made.</p><p>He does the easy ones first, moving on to the books that have fallen farther away, muttering curses to himself all the while. Finally, he’s only left with the one under the opposite bookshelf.</p><p>Jiang Cheng lowers himself to his knees and stretches a hand underneath the lowest shelf. It’s dusty and frankly rather disgusting – trust him to find the one part of Cloud Recesses that isn’t completely spick and span – but his fingers close around the pages after only a few seconds of feeling around. He pulls it back out.</p><p>The cover is nondescript, simple brown leather with a few elegant characters written on it in ink. <em>Genealogies Of The Cultivation Sects</em>. Utterly boring. The only remarkable thing about the book is its size: its thickness measures nearly Jiang Cheng’s whole hand.</p><p>Still, it belongs to the Lan sect and he’s a guest here, so it’s politeness that makes him flip the book over to smooth out any pages that may have been crumpled in the fall. He glances down, running his fingers over a crease in the page, and can’t help taking in a couple of the words.</p><p>The book is open to a page on the Wen clan. He sees Wen Ruohan’s name there. Wen Xu. Wen Qing and Wen Ning. Wen Chao. Below that, a note added in lighter ink, about Wen Zhuliu’s addition to the family annals.</p><p>His fingers still. Something sparks inside of Jiang Cheng, hot and stinging. He wants to close the book, but his eyes are drawn to the inked-black characters. He wants to snap it shut, but he can’t look away.</p><p>The genealogy is comprehensive, listing the birthdates of every person it names. The names of their weapons, their courtesy names, their distinguishing features. The details of their deaths.</p><p><em>Wen Chao. Killed in Nightless City by the Yiling Patriarch, Wei Wuxian</em>.</p><p>Bile rises in Jiang Cheng’s throat. He remembers the sting of the discipline whip as it hit his skin. The burning came later, after, but at first, all he could feel was the sharpness of it.</p><p>He forces himself to look away. Tells himself to close the book, and forces his uncooperative fingers to obey. But before they can, he catches sight of another line of characters, far below, at the bottom of the page.</p><p><em>Wen Yuan</em>.</p><p>The name sounds familiar. Born eighteen years ago. Eighteen years and two weeks, almost to the day.</p><p>
  <em>Birthmark located on the collarbone. Shaped like a star with four points.</em>
</p><p>That, too, sounds familiar. Where–?</p><p>Fingers of ice stroke his spine. He knows. He <em>has</em> seen it before, on a moonlit night by the cold springs. His nephew, caught with his hands all over another boy, blushing and stammering. And the other boy, panicked, pulling his robes over his bare chest. Obscuring a birthmark on his collarbone. It was barely a moment, but he knows what he saw. A four-pointed star like ink on his skin.</p><p>The boy. Lan Sizhui, two weeks after his eighteenth birthday. Lan Yuan.</p><p>No – <em>Wen </em>Yuan.</p><p>The pieces fall into place with a sickening clarity. Wei Wuxian’s insistence that the boy was adopted. The caged look in his eyes as he avoided saying where from. Wei Wuxian’s ties with the Wen clan. Wen Ning’s protectiveness. The boy’s own avoidance of him that can’t be explained away by simple apprehension of a protective future in-law.</p><p>No. <em>No. </em>It can’t be.</p><p>But even below that, there is a note. <em>Adopted into the Gusu Lan sect. Son of Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian</em>.</p><p>It can’t be. They’re all dead. Jiang Cheng killed them all.</p><p>He feels heat on his skin. Phantom flames caught on the wood of his home, splintered and burning like so much kindling. Licking at flesh. Dead flesh – all the people that he used to know, piled into mountains in his mother’s training yard.</p><p>It can’t be. All these years – he’s <em>safe</em>. He has to be.</p><p>Zidian sparks on his finger. But the sparks don’t fall to the paper beneath. They don’t catch, not like they did that night. Not like they do every night in his dreams.</p><p>It can’t be. But it is.</p><p>The flames work their way inside him. Into his lungs, choking him so he can’t breathe. It’s fine. He can already feel his mind detaching from his body, not shrinking inside him but floating away, untouchable. Soon he won’t feel anything at all.</p><p>Distantly, Jiang Cheng finishes smoothing out the crease in the paper. He shuts the book. Places it back on the shelf. Then he stands up and leaves.</p><p>Somewhere far away and faded, he can hear screaming.</p>

    <p>“Where is he?”, Jin Ling asks impatiently, arms folded across his chest. “It’s been twenty minutes already.”</p><p>Sizhui, from where he’s sitting across the table, a book in hand, gives him a look. “Ten, Jin Ling. It’s been ten minutes.”</p><p>Even so, Jin Ling’s eyebrows pull into a frown. For the past twenty – <em>ten</em>, then – minutes, he’s been in the room he and his uncle agreed to have dinner in, waiting for said uncle. It’s not a big concern; or at least, it wouldn’t be if the uncle in question was Wei Wuxian. But his <em>Jiu-jiu</em>…</p><p><em>Jiu-jiu</em> is never late.</p><p>In fact, he’s so frequently early to everything that Jin Ling is used to yelling back when his uncle scolds him for showing up late, because he’s usually on time and it’s just <em>Jiu-jiu</em> being unreasonable. The whole of Lotus Pier knows that he gets up at three every morning, for gods’ sake. Probably to catch wandering disciples out of bed or scold a stray servant on the night shift, is what Jin Ling’s always thought.</p><p>(For the past few years, though, he’s had a nagging suspicion that it might be something else. But his uncle has vehemently denied it at every turn, so Jin Ling is content to keep his assumptions.)</p><p>The fact remains that Uncle is always, <em>always</em> on time or early. Not showing up to a meeting ten minutes after the stipulated time is very far out of character for him, especially with how much he likes to nag Jin Ling about punctuality. He says as much to Sizhui, who then fixes him with a placid smile.</p><p>“If you’re so worried about your uncle, perhaps you should go look for him,” Sizhui suggests reasonably. Entirely too reasonably. Jin Ling flushes automatically.</p><p>“I’m not worried about him!”, he protests. “It’s just…not normal, is all.”</p><p>A lame finish. It’s true, though. Jin Ling doesn’t need to worry about his uncle; <em>Jiu-jiu </em>can take care of himself. But it’s strange, and Jin Ling doesn’t like not knowing what’s going on.</p><p>“If you say so,” is Sizhui’s response. By this time, he’s set his book down. He doesn’t even look surprised when Jin Ling stands up anyway and walks out of the room without so much as an explanation – just follows behind without a word.</p><p>From there, it’s only a short walk back to the corridor where Jin Ling and his uncle’s rooms are located. Jin Ling spends most of it trying to come up with reasons why <em>Jiu-jiu</em> would be late.</p><p>“Maybe he’s sleeping,” he suggests to Sizhui, who is remaining very quiet and expressionless. It looks as though he’s trying not to laugh. Jin Ling goes on regardless. “If he’s been sleeping this whole time, I’ll scold him, I really will. All this time he’s been lecturing <em>me</em> on punctuality–”</p><p>They reach <em>Jiu-jiu</em>’s room, and Jin Ling stops abruptly outside the door. It’s slightly ajar, a sliver of candlelight cast on the floor beneath the crack. A prickle of wrongness slides over Jin Ling’s skin.</p><p>Whether he’s in his room or somewhere else, <em>Jiu-jiu</em> always locks his door. He never leaves it open, and he makes everyone who wants to come in knock at least twice before they enter. The hallway is completely quiet too, which isn’t that unusual in and of itself, but for some reason, it adds to Jin Ling’s unease.</p><p>He knocks twice on the door and waits for the inevitable ‘come in’. It doesn’t come.</p><p>“<em>Jiu-jiu</em>?”, he calls. There’s no answer. He tries again and gets the same results. A glance back at Sizhui gives him no explanations either. (He doesn’t know why he expected it to.)</p><p>Jin Ling sets his palm against the door and pushes it open slowly. The hinges don’t even creak. He steps into the room after it, though Sizhui stays out in the hall. Jin Ling can’t really blame him – his uncle really is quite terrifying, if you don’t know how to handle him. Not that Jin Ling does either, but he’s got a better idea than most.</p><p>Add that to Sizhui’s “special situation” and well, it’s understandable why he might want to avoid Jin Ling’s uncle if possible. It’s already half a miracle his boyfriend has followed him out this far.</p><p>Turning his attention from the doorway, Jin Ling takes in the rest of the room. It’s not empty, as he’d first thought from the quiet of the corridor outside. The bed is made perfectly, not a single wrinkle on it anywhere, because that’s not where the room’s occupant is.</p><p>His <em>Jiu-jiu</em> is sitting cross-legged on the floor between the bed and the table. He’s still in his formal clothes, Sandu strapped to his waist as well. His eyes are closed, head bowed as if meditating. Jin Ling can’t hear his breathing, though, and alarm bells begin to sound inside his head.</p><p>There’s something wrong with his uncle. Something very wrong, apparent from the way he hadn’t even looked up when Jin Ling came in. But worse than that: when Jin Ling looks further down, <em>Jiu-jiu</em> has Zidian out in whip form, held loosely in his right hand while the razor-sharp end is wrapped tight around the fingers of his left. And it’s crackling, throwing violet sparks brighter and farther than Jin Ling’s ever seen it do outside of a real fight.</p><p>Something’s happened, and Jin Ling doesn’t know what. His stomach fills with lead.</p><p>“<em>Jiu-jiu</em>?”, he calls again, and when Uncle doesn’t respond, he lays his hand on his shoulder.</p><p>His eyes snap open. Jin Ling almost breathes a sigh of relief, but then he catches a glimpse of the look in them. Vacant, empty, like he’s seeing things that aren’t really there. Like he isn’t even really there.</p><p>The dread turns to panic. He’s never seen Uncle like this before. Like a shell without the person in it. Whatever Uncle is – strict, by turns snappish and downright wrathful, but always argumentative – he’s never just blank. He’s hard to predict but easy to read, and Jin Ling is suddenly <em>terrified</em> because he doesn’t know what this means.</p><p>“I came to tell you it’s time for dinner,” he says. His voice is wavering but he can’t bring himself to hate it right now. His uncle would hate it even more. He’s told him countless times to <em>speak with confidence, you hear me? No one’s going to listen to a sect leader who doesn’t sound sure of himself</em>.</p><p>Uncle doesn’t react.</p><p>This can’t be that serious, he reasons with himself. Nothing’s happened recently to set Uncle off – Jin Ling’s been relatively well-behaved for the past few days, and everything was fine this morning when Uncle woke him up and kicked him down to Caiyi Village to buy a few jars of <em>Tianzi-Xiao</em> for the servants back home. Even his relationship with Wei Wuxian has been on the mend lately, as embarrassing as Jin Ling’s other uncle is. Jin Ling’s overreacting. He has to be.</p><p>But the pounding of his heart doesn’t slow. If anything, it speeds up.</p><p>He turns back to the doorway, where Sizhui is standing now, having come halfway in to watch the proceedings with a strange look on his face.</p><p>“Sizhui,” he says helplessly, hoping his boyfriend will somehow know how to fix the situation. But Sizhui doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t have time, because at the sound of the name, the atmosphere <em>shifts</em> and Uncle is on his feet, Zidian suddenly unwound from his left hand and held out in front of him like he’s going to use it.</p><p>Jin Ling cries out. Uncle’s left hand, now free of the whip, hangs by his side. There are slices on his skin where Zidian has cut into it; as Jin Ling watches, blood wells up to the surface. It’s running down his fingers, but Uncle doesn’t even notice.</p><p>His eyes aren’t empty anymore, but this is no improvement, because all Jin Ling can see in them is fire. Sizhui comes in and stands beside him, though Jin Ling sees his mouth tighten.</p><p>“Sect Leader Jiang,” he says, and Jin Ling marvels at how even his voice is, “are you all right?”</p><p>Uncle’s head whips towards him so fast Jin Ling almost feels an answering pain in his neck. The blood drains from his face and Uncle goes pale, his eyes still burning with fury. He looks…inhuman.</p><p>“Get away from him,” he says, cold and cutting.</p><p>“Uncle–” Jin Ling protests, at the same time Sizhui says, “Sect Leader Jiang–”</p><p>“Shut up.” Uncle cuts them both off. He looks past Jin Ling like he isn’t even there; looks at Sizhui like he wants to rip his head off his shoulders. “Filthy Wen-dog.”</p><p>He says it low and soft, but Jin Ling hears every word. Cold washes over him head to toe, like he’s been dropped in an icy river with armour weighing him down.</p><p>
  <em>No.</em>
</p><p><em>He knows</em>.</p><p>Next to him, Sizhui’s face is the same colour as his robes. He’s trembling. Jin Ling wants to reach out for him, to hold his hand or something until he stops shaking, but he doesn’t know what his uncle will do. He wants to think everything will be fine, that Uncle will calm down and they can talk everything out, that Jin Ling can explain that this was all a misunderstanding and everything will be fine. That Uncle won’t do anything, will <em>listen</em> because they’re family, because he loves Jin Ling and Jin Ling loves Sizhui and everything will be fine.</p><p>But Jin Ling isn’t a fool. He’s grown up with <em>Jiu-jiu</em>’s rages. He’s seen <em>Jiu-jiu</em> return from some other place and sit in on his lessons with blood on his face that isn’t his. Jin Ling used to point it out nervously to him afterwards, and Uncle would wipe it off with his sleeve like it was sweat, a look of disgust written all over his face. All through Jin Ling’s childhood, those were the only times he was ever truly afraid of his uncle.</p><p>He’ll kill Sizhui. Jin Ling knows he exaggerates things a lot, but this isn’t one of those times. He’s really, truly afraid for Sizhui’s life.</p><p>“<em>Jiu-jiu</em>, calm down. We can talk this out–”</p><p>“Shut up,” Uncle snaps again, still not looking at him. “He should be dead. He should be rotting in the ground with everyone else in his filthy fucking family.”</p><p>Jin Ling hardly dares to breathe. Beside him, Sizhui’s shaking intensifies. <em>Oh, gods. Oh, gods.</em></p><p>How could this have happened? Everything was fine, and then–</p><p>He doesn’t even know what went wrong. He doesn’t know how to fix this. Jin Ling knows the Wens are a sore point for Sizhui, knows Sizhui hates that all everyone else sees in his family is murderers and monsters. Even hates himself a little for it, too. Jin Ling also knows that his uncle is one of those people who sees Sizhui’s family that way, that that’s how he’ll see Sizhui too.</p><p>This is his fault. Sizhui <em>told</em> him when they first got together that he should run as far and as fast as he could in the other direction, because nothing good could ever come of getting involved with a Wen. And Jin Ling didn’t listen, because everyone knew that Sizhui was as good as it was possible to be, and how could anyone ever think otherwise? Sizhui’s blood didn’t matter, he said, only who he was as a person. It wasn’t wrong – Jin Ling still believes that much – but he realises now that no one else will see it that way.</p><p>He was stupid, and now Sizhui is going to pay. This is all his fault.</p><p>“<em>Jiu-jiu</em>, please. Listen–”</p><p>But just like every time before, his uncle doesn’t let him finish. He takes a step forward, just so maybe his uncle will <em>look at him</em> and <em>listen</em>, but as soon as he gets close, Uncle’s left hand flies out and pushes him away.</p><p>Jin Ling stumbles with the force of it, catching himself against the wall. That <em>hurt</em>. He looks down; there’s a bloody imprint on the front of his robes, scarlet against gold in the shape of a palm and five fingers. The blood isn’t his.</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” Uncle says for the third time. He sounds dangerous, murderous, and Jin Ling realises that he hasn’t yet raised his voice above normal speech. He almost wishes he would yell. “Don’t fucking protect him. He’s not worth it. He’ll get you killed – it’s what they all do. Or maybe, if you’re really lucky and he <em>really</em> likes you, he’ll kill everyone you love instead.”</p><p>Suddenly, the tension that’s been building inside of Jin Ling snaps. This is his uncle, yes, but that’s Sizhui. Sizhui, who’s never hurt anyone in his life, who only ever raises his sword in defense of the innocent, who uses his <em>guqin</em> to make polite noises at spirits and carries Jin Ling back when he gets hurt on night-hunts.</p><p>“Don’t talk about him like that! Sizhui isn’t – he’s not any of the things you said! He’s not a monster, Uncle, and you don’t get to treat him like he is!”</p><p>It bursts out of him, loud in comparison with his uncle’s near-whispered accusations, and he’s petrified for a moment before it gets swept away by righteous anger. Sizhui doesn’t need to hear this shit, and Jin Ling would be no kind of a boyfriend at all if he just stood here and let him take it. Even from the man who raised him.</p><p>His uncle only laughs hollowly, the empty look back in his eyes. Inexplicably, it’s coexisting with the rage, and for all his own indignation, Jin Ling suppresses a shiver.</p><p>“Oh, but he is. He’s a Wen; they destroy everything they touch. They burn it until there’s nothing left.” Zidian crackles even louder, like dry logs placed over a fire. “They killed your grandparents, you know. Your father. Your <em>mother</em>.”</p><p>Jin Ling swallows against the lump rising in his throat. It doesn’t do any good – the tears spill over anyway. He hates them, hates how weak they make him look in the face of his uncle’s strength. Why can’t he just <em>listen</em>?</p><p>“But Sizhui didn’t! He was only a baby when my parents died, he didn’t do <em>anything</em>!”</p><p>He hears Sizhui swallow, too, and then <em>he’s</em> crying. That shouldn’t be happening. Sizhui isn’t supposed to cry. Nothing should ever make him have to.</p><p>Uncle’s arm twitches. Zidian lashes out. Suddenly, the desk splits in half. There are scorch marks on the wall. Jin Ling trembles, but doesn’t back down. He can’t. He and Sizhui are good cultivators – Sizhui especially – but neither of them are at <em>Jiu-jiu</em>’s level yet. If Jin Ling can’t stand up to him, Sizhui might end up like that desk.</p><p>“Maybe not,” his uncle replies. “But he will. They always do. Your father–”</p><p>“You’re not my father!”</p><p>Everything goes silent. Sizhui’s eyes widen. Jin Ling’s heart almost stops. He hadn’t meant to say that. It just…came out.</p><p>But the biggest change is in his uncle. It’s like he was a ball filled with air, and Jin Ling’s come along and poked a hole in him. All the anger rushes out – Jin Ling can <em>see</em> it leave him – leaving only that terrifying blankness. Zidian reverts to ring form, even as a drop of blood oozes from the cuts on his hand and hits the floor.</p><p>“You’re right,” he says. It’s even softer than before. “I’m not your father.”</p><p>“Uncle–”</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>“­<em>Jiu-jiu</em>, please–”</p><p>“I said, <em>get out</em>. You want to run around with a Wen, be my guest. But don’t come crying to me when he crushes everything you hold dear. As you said, I’m not your father. I’m just the lucky bastard who got called in to be your fucking last resort.”</p><p>“Stop it, please Uncle, just listen to me–”</p><p>He takes a step closer, uncaring that he’s begging, that he’s sixteen and crying in front of his uncle like he’s five years old again. He can fix this, he knows it, Uncle just has to listen and everything will be okay again. If he can just make him <em>listen</em>.</p><p><em>Jiu-jiu</em> shoves him again, leaving another bloody handprint.</p><p>“Get the fuck out!”</p><p>Gone are the threatening whispers; he roars. There’s a hand on his sword and Sandu emerges from its sheath, the first three inches of gleaming steel. Jin Ling is sobbing so hard he thinks he might throw up, and this is the worst fight he’s ever had with his uncle in his whole life.</p><p>For the first time, he’s the target of Sandu-Shengshou’s legendary rage. His uncle, who is the only living blood relative he has left. The man who taught him to walk, to shoot a bow, to fly on a sword.</p><p>Jin Ling grabs Sizhui by the arm and runs out of the room.</p>

    <p>After Jin Ling leaves, Jiang Cheng trashes his room. He uses Zidian to reduce the ruined desk to a stack of firewood, good for nothing more than kindling. But it’s not enough. It doesn’t soothe the rage in his soul, or the awful feeling that everything good and pure that he has left has just been destroyed.</p><p>So Jiang Cheng siphons his spiritual energy away from his hands, lets Zidian revert back to ring form. And proceeds to smash everything breakable in the room.</p><p>He doesn’t use his <em>lingqi</em>. That would be cheating. And besides, he doesn’t want to think about the golden core sitting in his chest right now – not now, not ever. Instead, he uses his hands and his feet. He throws things; he kicks them; he demolishes a chair, a shelf and all the dishes in the kitchen until splinters and porcelain shards litter the floor.</p><p>When he’s done wrecking the furniture, Jiang Cheng punches the wall. He’s strong, but it’s stone and so the impact jars every bone in his arm, all the way up to his teeth and sends a shockwave through his entire body. He feels his knuckles crunch and knows they’ll be healed by tomorrow.</p><p>It’s that that brings him out of the mindless haze he’s fallen into somewhere between Jin Ling’s departure and his current sorry state. Gods, <em>Jin Ling</em>. He cradles his bruised (and probably swelling) hand against his chest and sags against the wall.</p><p>Jin Ling and the Lan boy. No – the Wen boy. Jiang Cheng can feel himself getting angry again, but it’s tempered with despair. His nephew’s words ring in his ears.</p><p>
  <em>You’re not my father!</em>
</p><p>He looks down at his hands, one cut and one bruised, one half going purple and the other still weeping blood, slower now that it’s begun to dry and congeal. All these years, Jiang Cheng has always known where he stands. He isn’t Jin Ling’s father, no; the boy was right about that. He’s not his mother, either. And he’s been fine with that – those aren’t his roles to fill.</p><p>His job is to make sure Jin Ling is safe and happy. That’s it. Jiang Cheng thinks of his nephew’s tear-stained face, the hitches in his voice as he begged him to listen. The way he flinched away from him like he thought Jiang Cheng would strike him, even though Jiang Cheng has never, ever hit his nephew. He’s a failure at even that one simple task, but then what else is new?</p><p>And the Wen boy, Wen Yuan…</p><p>The old rage rises in him at the name, just as it always does, accompanied by Wen Chao’s grinning face. That clan took everything from him: his family, his home, the last fragile bits of innocence he’d managed to cling onto after seventeen years. They took <em>everything</em>.</p><p>And yet, the people Jiang Cheng loves keep choosing them. Always. First his brother, now his nephew. Why? Is his everything worth so little?</p><p>There, sitting on the floor in a borrowed room, surrounded by the wreckage of borrowed things in a sect that is not his own, Jiang Cheng realises for the first time the true source of his hatred. It’s not just what they did to him, though that is part of it. What they took from him…he never had it in the first place.</p><p>He’s blamed them all this time for the loss of his mother, his father, his sister, his brother, because it was easier to believe that they’d been taken from him. That they’d wanted to stay, that they never would have left him if they’d had the choice. It was easier to blame the Wens for taking that choice away from them, than it was to acknowledge that everyone on his long fucking list had had that choice, and their answer hadn’t been him.</p><p>His mother had wanted him to be strong more than she’d wanted him to be loved. His father – well, his father had been walking away from Jiang Cheng since before he was ten, and nothing he did was ever enough to make him turn back around.</p><p><em>Ah-Jie…</em> Ah-Jie had loved him, he knows. Really and truly. But he’d never been her first choice. Had never smiled bright enough, never laughed loud enough to be first in her heart, and when she finally found the love she deserved with that golden fucking peacock, her youngest brother fell even further behind.</p><p>He doesn’t blame her – them, really – for leaving him behind. Hell, sometimes he wishes he could do the same. But it hurt. It hurt too much for him to acknowledge, and so he turned it into another reason for him to hate someone other than himself.</p><p>It still hurts. Everything hurts – a jumbled-up mess of rage and pain and sadness like a fog so thick Jiang Cheng can barely see his hand held out in front of him. It’s so <em>loud</em> inside his head.</p><p>He wants it to be quiet for a little while.</p><p>Jiang Cheng lurches to his feet, walks towards the only corner of the room he hasn’t touched this whole time. There are jars there, the wine he asked Jin Ling to run down to Caiyi Village and get this morning to take back for the servants when he leaves. He’s had alcohol before – been drunk before too, obviously, the hideous patchwork on his chest is proof enough of that – and he knows that despite the haze of hangovers and bad decisions the morning after, the night itself is sweet relief. He just wants to stop himself from thinking, and no one’s here to care how he does it.</p><p>(It’s better than the other option.)</p><p>He kneels and reaches for the first jar. Tells himself <em>just enough to forget. Just for a little while.</em></p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Three – no, is that five? – jars later, and Jiang Cheng can’t remember why he was so upset in the first place. But it doesn’t quite seem to have worked, because the awful blue haze hasn’t gone away and he still feels like shit. With the added bonus of misplacing every bit of coordination he might once have possessed, losing his balance when he tries to stand up, and falling to the floor when his foot goes <em>here</em> instead of <em>there</em>.</p><p>It takes him another two tries, but he finally gets himself upright again. He should go to bed; really, he should, because the alcohol and everything that has happened today that he can’t remember has made him so very tired. But he looks over at the bed, the only thing unbroken in the wreckage that is the rest of the room – when did he do all of that? – and the thought of sleeping here turns his stomach.</p><p>Jiang Cheng also knows, somehow, that if he goes to sleep now, the nightmares will come. He’d rather stay up all night instead.</p><p>And so he pushes off the wall and staggers out of his room, trying to lock the door behind him but struggling to fit the key in the lock and eventually giving up. There’s nothing worth stealing in there anyway, not unless one has a taste for broken chair legs and the jagged handles of broken teapots.</p><p>He turns right and starts walking – slowly, more clumsily than not, arm thrown out against the wall because his balance has been <em>shot</em> by all the wine he’s drunk. He doesn’t know where he’s going, doesn’t have a destination in mind, but there’s an itch in his veins so he keeps walking anyway.</p><p>Only a tiny part of him is still aware enough to hope that no one sees him.</p><p> </p>
<hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lan Huan is in the living room, putting things away and getting ready for bed when the front door makes a noise like someone’s crashed into it. Not hard – just like they simply weren’t looking where they were going and met a wall instead of the next step in their path.</p><p>He pauses with his hand on a stack of documents he’s just finished signing off on. Who could be here at this time of night? It’s a little after nine; the only reason he isn’t already asleep is that there had been two more reports he’d wanted to get through and he’d delayed his bedtime a few minutes to meet that goal. No one else in Cloud Recesses would even dream of being out-of-doors at this time of night – the rest of them are probably all in bed themselves.</p><p>Lan Huan moves the documents to their proper place and makes his way to the door. He opens it.</p><p>“Hello?”, he’s about to say, but it turns into an undignified yelp when something large and heavy pitches into his arms. No – make that some<em>one</em>.</p><p>Muffled cursing comes from the person he’s kind of-sort of holding. It’s that and the familiar violet of the intruder’s robes that clue Lan Huan into who this is. Shock takes root in his chest.</p><p>“Wanyin?”, he asks, taking hold of the other man’s shoulders and pushing him backwards so Lan Huan can see his face. “What happened?”</p><p>The younger sect leader looks – pardon Lan Huan’s language – frankly, like shit. His face is pale, eyes bloodshot and in the dim light spilling from the inside of the cottage, Lan Huan can see clear streaks shining on his cheeks.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin barely seems to notice his own tears. He mumbles something incoherent, then his knees buckle and he grabs onto Lan Huan’s shoulder to steady himself. Out of the corner of his eye, Lan Huan notices a flash of red. Before the other man can protest, Lan Huan has taken his hand off his shoulder and is examining it.</p><p>The skin is streaked with blood, dried and sticky, and there are long, thin slices in it, as if Jiang Wanyin was holding on too hard to the blade of a knife. Those definitely weren’t there this afternoon. Lan Huan’s stomach twists.</p><p>He reaches for the man’s other hand, but Jiang Wanyin pulls it out of reach.</p><p>“M’okay,” he insists, words slurred. It’s the first thing he’s said that Lan Huan’s been able to recognise as human speech. “S’just a little cut. No big deal.”</p><p>Lan Huan’s worry intensifies.</p><p>“Wanyin, are you drunk?”</p><p>“No?”, he says, but it comes out like a question. He clenches his fist, and a sharp gasp escapes his mouth. “Maybe?”</p><p>Oh, no. This is bad. This is very bad. Lan Huan has absolutely <em>no</em> idea how to handle this. And there’s obviously something very wrong with Jiang Wanyin, even though he doesn’t know what it is.</p><p>He reaches for the cut hand, and surprisingly, the other man lets him take it. He pries it open, unfolding the fingers to lessen the pressure on the gashes. Jiang Wanyin doesn’t even make a sound.</p><p>Then Lan Huan pulls back. Another tear is running down the other sect leader’s cheek. He doesn’t seem to notice that one either. Lan Huan’s heart twists in tandem with his stomach, and he can’t resist reaching up to wipe it away.</p><p>At the contact, Jiang Wanyin lets out a soft, broken sound, then immediately looks angry at himself for showing such weakness. Lan Huan is torn between laughing and crying himself. This man, always fighting. Doesn’t he know Lan Huan won’t judge him? Heaven knows he’s seen Lan Huan cry enough times.</p><p>He grasps Jiang Wanyin’s forearm, and the other man lets himself be tugged into the living room he was in just this afternoon. Lan Huan doesn’t have any chairs – except the one, but it’s more appropriate as a torture device and hardly counts as furniture – so he makes him sit on the floor. As Lan Huan retrieves bandages and salve from a barely-opened drawer near the bookshelves, he watches the younger sect leader out of the corner of his eye.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin is looking around the room as though he’s never been in it before, eyes wider than he’s ever seen them. Now and then his gaze breaks and darts to Lan Huan, where it remains for another few seconds before slowly drifting back to the sparse furniture. He is by turns vulnerable and terrifying. Lan Huan can’t stop his mind from circling right back to that first question: what on earth has happened to make him react this way?</p><p>When he returns with the medical supplies and seats himself, he takes Jiang Wanyin’s hand again. Spreads a thin layer of salve over the wounds – the other man doesn’t even hiss at the sting – and bandages it. He does the same with Jiang Wanyin’s other hand, once the man stops being stubborn and shows it to him. It’s horribly bruised; the first two fingers are swollen far beyond their normal size.</p><p>It will be down by tomorrow – Jiang Wanyin’s high cultivation level will have taken care of it – but right now, it must hurt.</p><p>Lan Huan doesn’t want him to suffer any more than he needs to.</p><p>Then, suddenly, a strange nosie escapes Jiang Wanyin’s mouth, halfway between a gasp and a strangled cry. Lan Huan’s head jerks up. The other man is staring at him, the look on his face the most lucid he’s been tonight.</p><p>“Did you know?”</p><p>His voice is clear but wavering. As though he’s afraid of the answer. But Lan Huan can’t understand what he’s so afraid of. Can’t even understand what he’s asking.</p><p>“What do you mean?”, Lan Huan asks back, keeping his tone as gentle as possible, the verbal equivalent of the healer’s soothing touches he’d been attempting to mimic with the salve and bandages.</p><p>But the other man doesn’t reply. Just turns his face away as though that were answer enough. “Of course you did.”</p><p>His shoulders have begun to shake. Lan Huan reaches out for him, but his hand stills in midair. He remembers what happened last time. He wants to hold him, to comfort him, but he doesn’t know how far gone Jiang Wanyin is into his own mind, and that alone stays his hand.</p><p>“What are you talking about, Wanyin?” Lan Huan fights to remain calm. “I’ll answer any question you have; you just have to tell me what it is you want to know.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have come here. I don’t know what I was thinking–”</p><p>As a matter of fact, Lan Huan too would like to know what he was thinking. He doesn’t say it, though. And when Jiang Wanyin makes an abortive movement as if to rise, Lan Huan does the only thing he can think of. He grabs his wrist again, holds firm so the other man isn’t going anywhere. In his inebriated state, Jiang Wanyin won’t be able to break his grip.</p><p>“Tell me what’s wrong.” Lan Huan means to sound stern and commanding, but it comes out like a plea. It’s those words that do it. He can see the exact moment something breaks in Jiang Wanyin’s eyes.</p><p>“It was a lie!”, he yells, and it’s like a dam has broken. “It was all a fucking lie! Years and years – I thought they were all dead, but there’s always more of them.”</p><p>He’s shouting now, uncaring that his voice is ringing, deafening, within the narrow walls of Lan Huan’s tiny living room. And Lan Huan…</p><p>Lan Huan’s blood turns to ice. Has he found out – does he know? No, he can’t. It’s a secret that only a few are privy to. Him, <em>Shu-Fu</em>, Wangji and his husband. Sizhui himself. Not even the elders know.</p><p>
  <em>How?</em>
</p><p>“Why?”, the other man asks, but Lan Huan can barely hear him for the roaring in his ears. Oh, gods. What has Jiang Wanyin done? Has he hurt Sizhui? Has he– <em>oh, gods</em>.</p><p>“They killed everyone. They took <em>everything</em>. Why do they get to survive when we didn’t?”</p><p>It’s that that shocks Lan Huan back to reality. Instantly, he knows that his worries, if not unfounded, are at least untrue. This isn’t a man in the throes of murderous rage. The blood on his hands is his own, not Lan Huan’s nephew’s. This is a man broken, who has had his carefully pieced-together world ripped apart for the umpteenth time and is dealing with it the only way he knows how: lashing out.</p><p>Lan Huan should have realised how deep it ran. He had an inkling of it the other day by the cold springs when Jiang Wanyin fell apart in his arms, desperately muttering to himself about how they were <em>all dead</em>, how <em>they can’t hurt him because they’re all dead</em>. The phrase like a child’s security blanket.</p><p>And now this. <em>Why do they get to survive when we didn’t?</em> We. As though Jiang Wanyin thinks that he, too, died in that fire with the rest of his sect.</p><p>Though Lan Huan has never condoned hate for another human being – the same kind practically radiating off Jiang Wanyin now – he knows that feeling. Over the past year, in some of his nightmares, he has been trapped in the tomb with his two sworn brothers, powerless to do anything but watch as they rip each other apart. And try as he might, he hadn’t been able to stop the bitterness from rising in his chest at the way Sizhui, Jingyi and the young Jin boy had smiled and laughed with each other.</p><p>He’d done handstands for hours afterwards, trying to make his arms burn severely enough to atone for the awful thoughts, but in that moment, he’d understood exactly what Jiang Wanyin is saying right now.</p><p>Gods help him, but he understands.</p><p>So Lan Huan swallows the fear that rises in him at the thought of Sandu-Shengshou attacking his nephew, and he does what he ought to have done from the beginning. He asks what happened.</p>

    <p>It’s simultaneously better and worse than Lan Huan thought.</p><p>By the time Jiang Wanyin is done talking – well, more like ranting in between bouts of hyperventilation and tears the younger man refuses to acknowledge – Lan Huan knows that both Sizhui and Young Master Jin are unharmed. That’s the ‘better’ part. It’s a relief, at least.</p><p>But the rest of it…</p><p>He’d said Sizhui deserved to <em>die</em>. Little Sizhui, whose diapers Lan Huan had changed on the days Wangji couldn’t find the strength to get out of bed. Sizhui, who was the best of all three of them: Wei Wuxian, Wangji and him. Sizhui, who cried when he heard who his family was, whose descendant he was, because he’d heard nothing but slander about the sect he was born to and he was so afraid he’d become that.</p><p>And when they told him that he wouldn’t, that even though some members of his family had done awful, terrible things, that didn’t make them all bad, Sizhui cried again. Because he knew that it didn’t matter how good he was, how high his cultivation level was or how hard he tried to be righteous. If people found out the truth about his birth sect, they would only ever see him as a monster. Would never see him for the person that he is.</p><p>What Jiang Wanyin has said to him is the last thing the boy needs. They’ve worked so hard to get Sizhui to this point, where he’s all right with who he is, albeit not completely comfortable. Lan Huan knows through Wangji that his nephew told Young Master Jin about his heritage, and the two only grew closer because of it. It was the best kind of progress.</p><p>This could set Sizhui back months.</p><p>But as Lan Huan looks at the man opposite him, at the fist Jiang Wanyin has clenched hard enough to re-open his wounds and stain the bandage red, at the pale face streaked with angry tears he hasn’t bothered to wipe away, he can’t muster up the will to hate him. Not just because of Lan Huan’s recently acknowledged…affection towards him, but because he knows he doesn’t understand this.</p><p>He doesn’t know what it is to lose everything, to be cast adrift in the world with nothing at all except ashes and the bare bones of a new life he’s built with his own two hands. To be so afraid of the shadows of his past that the only thing keeping him anchored is the belief that they are dead, and he is the one still breathing.</p><p>What Lan Huan understands is the pain of loss. To lose <em>almost</em> everything, and be so afraid of losing the rest that he pulls himself inward rather than drag what he has left down with him.</p><p>Lan Huan understands enough to know that he doesn’t really understand anything at all. And so he steels himself for what he is about to say. Straightens up and speaks in a tone as firm as he can make it, but as gentle too.</p><p>“You have to let go of your hatred, Wanyin. You have to, or it will destroy you.” The other man freezes, staring at him. The thready red veins in his eyes make the blue shine even brighter. “You’re my friend, but I won’t let you talk to my nephew that way. Sizhui is my family, and a good person, a good cultivator. He should not have to pay for the sins of a family he never knew.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin’s mouth twitches with the ghost of a bitter smile.</p><p>“That’s what Jin Ling said. Seems he’s more like you than me.”</p><p>“I don’t think so.” Lan Huan’s automatic response startles them both. “I think that’s something you would do. Stand up for someone you love, even if it hurts.”</p><p>“Fat fucking lot of good that did me.”</p><p>The other man’s words are soft, directed more at himself than Lan Huan. Lan Huan’s stomach tenses. There’s something in Jiang Wanyin’s voice that says this is big. A secret he’s been keeping for a very long time. But then he twists his ring around his finger and snorts.</p><p>“Jin Ling…I guess I fucked that up too, then. Hurt him, even though all I did was shout a bit and push him a couple times.”</p><p>Suddenly, he looks very small and sad, all the fight gone out of him. “Tell me, Xichen, why is it so easy to hurt people?”</p><p>“It isn’t.” Jiang Wanyin looks about to protest, but Lan Huan continues before he can make a sound. “Not if they don’t love us. We can only hurt the people who love us, you know. Because it matters to them, what we say. What we do.”</p><p>“He must hate me now. For what I said; what I did.”</p><p>“He doesn’t.” Lan Huan cuts him off again, the <em>how can you know?</em> dying before it even reaches the open air. “Trust me. If you love someone, you’ll–”</p><p>His voice breaks.</p><p>“You’ll forgive them almost anything.”</p><p>The reply he gets is faint. A wisp of a thing, like it might float away on the wind. But so, so earnest. It takes Lan Huan’s breath away.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” it says. “I’m sorry they took advantage of you like that, of your forgiveness. They didn’t know how lucky they were, that you loved them like that.”</p><p><em>I could love you like that</em>, Lan Huan doesn’t say. <em>Not now, but maybe one day. If you’d let me.</em></p><p>“I think your nephew loves you like that,” what he says instead. It’s the truth – or at least what Lan Huan thinks is the truth – but Jiang Wanyin’s shoulders slump. They begin to tremble again; this time, Lan Huan doesn’t think it’s from suppressed rage.</p><p>The alcohol must have loosened his tongue more than he’d thought – gods, how much did he <em>drink</em>? – because Lan Huan isn’t prepared for the sheer sincerity in Jiang Wanyin’s voice when he replies, “I wish somebody did.”</p><p>“I’m sure they do–”</p><p>“He should have left me there.” Jiang Wanyin’s eyes flutter shut, and Lan Huan’s chest tightens. “He didn’t even love me enough for that.”</p><p><em>Who–? </em>What on <em>earth</em> is he talking about? Lan Huan’s mind whirls even as his stomach plummets. He doesn’t think this is about Young Master Jin anymore, but he can’t figure out who it is about.</p><p>“W-what do you mean?”</p><p>The younger man shakes his head, eyes still closed. He huffs out a laugh. “I’m not supposed to tell you. It’s a secret. A real one; not like the ones I’ve been finding out lately that everybody knows but me. Nobody knows this one but me.”</p><p>It sounds like he’s babbling nonsense now, drunk out of his head, but there’s something in his voice that makes Lan Huan listen closer. His heart pounds wildly. Jiang Wanyin continues.</p><p>“But what the hell, right? It’s not like it matters now. It never mattered anyway – he made sure of that.”</p><p>And so in fits and starts, in long rambling tangents far from the other man’s normally concise way of speaking, Lan Huan hears the story of how at seventeen, Jiang Wanyin offered himself up as a distraction to save his brother. How, newly orphaned and half-mad with grief, he’d let himself be dragged back to the burned-out husk of his home and tortured, simply to spare one of the only people he had left the same fate.</p><p>Lan Huan thinks about the scar on Jiang Wanyin’s chest, how he’d glossed over the events leading up to it as if they weren’t worth mentioning. <em>Got myself captured by Wen Chao and his merry band of douchebags. It’s not important how</em>.</p><p>But it was. It is. His chest feels tight.</p><p>“Then Wei Wuxian showed back up and busted my ass out of there, and I woke up with his fucking golden core in my chest.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin laughs again, but it’s even uglier than the first time. Hollow and jagged like a broken lamp, all the oil inside spilling across the floor. Lan Huan reaches out for his hand and tries to convince himself that it’s only because the younger sect leader has begun to dig his fingers into the bandage, and Lan Huan is worried he might worsen his wounds.</p><p>“Your brother cares for you,” he says softly. “That was his sacrifice.”</p><p>It’s the exact wrong thing to say. Jiang Wanyin’s face contorts in a sneer.</p><p>“And what of mine? I gave up <em>everything </em>for him: my body, my life. My core. He should have left me there. I wish he had. Instead, he took all that I gave him and threw it back in my face. And he was a hero for it.”</p><p>“I’m just a fucking hypocrite.”</p><p>Lan Huan shifts his hand to tangle Jiang Wanyin’s fingers in his. The other man barely notices. He just talks, as though he’s been keeping this bottled up inside him forever and is now only getting to let it all out. Now that Lan Huan thinks about it, that’s exactly what this is.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin was seventeen when all this happened. He’s thirty-four now. Half his lifetime carrying this secret.</p><p>“I wish he’d left me there,” he repeats. “At least then it would have meant something. I would have died for him, you know.”</p><p>Lan Huan think of his own little brother. His face, so like Lan Huan’s own, but always so serious. His eyes, lighter than Lan Huan’s, the only part of him that ever smiles.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I wish he’d thought my life was worth as much as his.”</p><p>He doesn’t know what to say to that. It’s so awful, so <em>wrong</em>, and yet it makes a kind of twisted sense that Jiang Wanyin feels this way. He would, wouldn’t he? He believes he’ll never be good enough, and he thinks everything that has ever happened to him is just proof of that.</p><p>In the end, he just says: “if Wangji ever tried to take an arrow for me, I’d push him out of the way.”</p><p>“But it would be his <em>choice</em>–”</p><p>“And it would be my choice not to let him. I love him just as much as he loves me. It doesn’t mean that his sacrifice wouldn’t mean anything – mine wouldn’t cancel his out. Just as your brother’s sacrifice doesn’t make yours any less significant. Family runs both ways, Wanyin. No one’s any more important than anyone else.”</p><p>The other man’s face scrunches up. For a single, horrible moment, Lan Huan thinks he’s going to argue with him. But then his eyelids slide closed again, forcing twin drops of water down his cheeks.</p><p>“I should leave,” he says, and Lan Huan has never heard those three words sound so grateful in his life. Jiang Wanyin wipes at his face self-consciously, finally seeming to notice his tears for the first time tonight.</p><p>Lan Huan’s heart hurts, and the words are out of his mouth before they even have time to run all the way through his head.</p><p>“You’re in no shape to go back,” he says. For some reason, he sounds confident. “Honestly, I have no idea how you made it this far without collapsing on your feet, but you’re not going anywhere for the rest of the night.”</p><p>The younger man makes a token protest, but he gives way easily enough when Lan Huan puts his foot down that he thinks Jiang Wanyin might not want to be alone right now after all.</p><p>“I’ll sleep on the floor, then.”</p><p>Lan Huan can’t tell who says it first, because they say it at the same time. That won’t do at all. Lan Huan shakes his head.</p><p>“You’re taking the bed. I’ll be fine out here.”</p><p>“Don’t be an idiot. You don’t even have a sofa. I’m not stealing your bed.”</p><p>His cheeks are still damp, but the other sect leader’s arms are folded across his chest in the very picture of obstinacy. Lan Huan suppresses a sigh. Aren’t drunk people supposed to be suggestible? It would make this <em>so</em> much easier.</p><p>But then when has Jiang Wanyin ever made anything easy?</p><p>They argue for a few more minutes before Jiang Wanyin’s tiredness seems to catch up with him. He sways a little where he’s seated upright, nearly falling over. Lan Huan gives him a significant look, and the other man scowls.</p><p>“Fine,” he bites out, attempts to stand, and actually does fall over this time. It would be funny if this weren’t the saddest display Lan Huan has ever seen from him. Sighing again, he helps peel Jiang Wanyin off the floor.</p><p>“Behave yourself,” he reminds him sternly, throwing Jiang Wanyin’s arm over his shoulder and moving his own arm to hold his waist. Lan Huan can actually <em>feel</em> him go red.</p><p>“If you tell anyone about this, I’ll break both your legs and theirs.”</p><p>“I won’t tell a soul,” he promises, feeling his heart go a little soft. Jiang Wanyin is very warm.</p><p>Lan Huan moves them both to his bedroom and somehow manages to maneuver the other man so that he ends up in a respectable position on the bed. Jiang Wanyin struggles with his boots for a while, but he can’t seem to get his bandaged fingers to work right, so Lan Huan takes them off for him and sets them in a corner. It’s oddly intimate, and Lan Huan resists the embarrassing urge to cover his face and run off to hide in the bathroom.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin did this for him the other night, when it was Lan Huan drunk off his ass and undoubtedly heaping shame upon his entire sect. He supposes he needs to return the favour.</p><p>He watches as the younger man undoes his hair and lets it fall down his back, then lies down as if he’s too exhausted to sit up anymore.</p><p>“You can fix things with your nephew, you know,” Lan Huan says, as Jiang Wanyin continues to look at him. “He’ll forgive you.”</p><p>He doesn’t receive an answer.</p><p>“You’ll need to apologise to Sizhui too, of course.” That gets him a nod, and a soft sound that might be concession. Bolstered by it, Lan Huan decides to test the bounds of Jiang Wanyin’s newfound docility.</p><p>“And you should talk to your brother. Tell him what you told me.”</p><p>“I don’t want to.” His voice is very small and tired. “He doesn’t need to know.”</p><p>“Maybe not,” Lan Huan agrees, “but he deserves to. Just as you deserved to know about what he did for you. It doesn’t have to be tomorrow. But you should think about it someday. Soon, if you can.”</p><p>He turns to leave, but stops in his tracks when he hears a word, softly spoken.</p><p>“Please– please stay.”</p><p>It’s that simple request that sets his heart racing in his chest. Because it’s not <em>please don’t go</em>. That’s desperation, loneliness. It means <em>don’t leave me alone. I need someone, anyone</em>. But Jiang Wanyin is asking him to stay.</p><p><em>Please stay</em> means <em>I need you.</em></p><p>Lan Huan is slowly discovering that he can’t say no when Jiang Wanyin asks him like that. He removes his own boots and sits down on the bed, uncaring that he’s likely creasing his robes beyond any semblance of propriety. Then he sets an arm around Jiang Wanyin, who curls against his side. There is wetness leaking through to his skin where the younger man’s face is pressed to his robes, but he finds he doesn’t care.</p><p>Lan Huan stays.</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng wakes to a pounding in his head, the taste of bad decisions in his mouth, and a sinking feeling that he’s messed up epically somehow. Then his stomach lurches, and he has to concentrate all the energy in his tired mind on not throwing up in bed.</p><p>Ah, yes, the joys of alcohol, he thinks to himself once the nausea has more or less abated. He recalls emptying an assortment of jars last night. Those were for his sect members back at Lotus Pier; he’ll have to replace them.</p><p>Suddenly, he becomes aware that he’s very warm – almost hot. A pair of arms is wrapped around him, over his shoulders and across his front; there’s a solid warmth at his back that suggests that someone’s chest is there too. And, mortifyingly, the person holding him has draped their leg over his thigh.</p><p>What the actual <em>fuck</em> did he do last night? Did he–?</p><p>But no, he’s still wearing all his clothes. He doesn’t feel anything at all, really, other than the slowly intensifying pain in his head. And the warm, huffing breath of the other person in the bed on the back of his neck. It’s…not unpleasant.</p><p>Then Jiang Cheng realises that there’s no softness in the chest that’s pressed against his back, and that by proportion of the arms and legs that are everywhere at this point, the other person is probably bigger than he is.</p><p><em>Holy fucking shit</em>.</p><p>The events of last night come rushing back. Jiang Cheng is overcome by the sudden desire to dig himself a hole, crawl into it and die. Oh gods, did he really say all that? Did he really…ask Lan Xichen to stay? With him?</p><p>He’s never going to be able to look the other sect leader in the eye ever again.</p><p>But even as the embarrassment washes over him, he remembers some of the <em>other</em> shit he said last night. It’s like getting pushed into the cold springs without any prior warning.</p><p><em>I would have died for him, you know</em>.</p><p>Did he really admit to that? Spill his secret to Lan Xichen? No one was ever supposed to know what he did. It happened seventeen years ago, half a lifetime in the past and as far as Jiang Cheng is concerned, it can stay there. The real reason for the scar on his chest, for every agonising second of the humiliation and pain, for the countless nights spent awake for the shame of what he’d allowed to be done to him, for the bits of him that were taken away and never replaced.</p><p>He was supposed to take it to his grave. He’d never wanted it to get out; what would have been the point? No one would think Jiang Cheng a hero – all that sacrifice and here he is, a sect leader with a fearsome reputation, two holy weapons and a working fucking core.</p><p>It wouldn’t make his brother come back, either. He has a new home, and it isn’t Lotus Pier. Either way, Wei Wuxian’s own sacrifices absolve him of any guilt in the matter. He won’t come home, and Jiang Cheng has enough dignity left not to beg him to.</p><p>So what good is his truth, except to hold close to himself at night and remind him of all the ways he’s failed? No, Jiang Cheng never wanted anyone to find out.</p><p>And yet he told Lan Xichen. Of his own free will, no coercion necessary. No <em>tell me</em>, no <em>please</em> – it just came out. Jiang Cheng wants to blame it on the five jars of wine he’d emptied before showing up here, but he knows it’s not that simple.</p><p>If it had been anyone but Lan Xichen, he wouldn’t have said anything.</p><p>(He has a sinking feeling that if it had been anyone but Lan Xichen, he wouldn’t have come to the cottage at all.)</p><p>Which leaves him in the awkward position of sharing a bed with another sect leader, who is currently wrapped around him like a sort of octopus-thing, and who has also seen him drunk and crying and gods-know-what-else. And knows almost all of his ugliest secrets.</p><p>But he’s still here. Lan Xichen is still here. He hasn’t run away, hasn’t called Jiang Cheng a monster or denounced him as a lost cause. He hasn’t given up on him. It’s then that Jiang Cheng realises that this is the first night in a long time that he hasn’t woken up screaming.</p><p>The thought makes him uncomfortable, so he pushes it to the back of his still-pounding head and gets up. Or attempts to. The moment he begins to shift, Lan Xichen’s arms tighten around him and the man makes a soft noise of protest.</p><p>Jiang Cheng checks to see if he’s still asleep. He is.</p><p>Then Lan Xichen mumbles something unintelligible and buries his face in the crook of Jiang Cheng’s neck. Jiang Cheng’s cheeks flame red; he can feel the burning even in the darkened room.</p><p>This is not appropriate. At all. In those shitty romance novels Wei Wuxian used to make him read, this sort of situation was always a preclude to–</p><p>He can’t even finish that sentence.</p><p>“Let go of me, will you?”, he grumbles softly, not raising his voice above a whisper. No answer. The other sect leader just holds on tighter. If Jiang Cheng didn’t know better, he’d think Lan Xichen is doing this just to spite him.</p><p>“Figures.”</p><p>He’d never admit it, but Lan Xichen’s arms around him make him feel safe. He hasn’t been held like this in a long time. Maybe ever. Jiang Cheng shuts his eyes, and lets himself fall back asleep.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Lan Huan finally wakes, it’s because he can’t breathe. He pulls his head back for air and discovers that at some point, while waiting for Jiang Wanyin to fall asleep, he did the same. From there, it was only a little shifting in the night that caused him to wind up draped over the younger man like a blanket – the actual article having been pushed to the foot of the bed to barely cover their feet – nose buried in Jiang Wanyin’s thick, dark hair.</p><p>His leg is thrown over the other sect leader’s thighs. In his arms, the man sleeps soundly, his breaths deep and regular. Lan Huan counts them, just because he can.</p><p>In his half-awake state, Lan Huan is warm and content. He hasn’t held anyone like this, he thinks lazily, oh, since he was seven or so and Wangji kept crawling into his bed to escape from the nightmares. He knew his baby brother wanted to be held – though he never voiced it – and so he did. Slept curled around him to make him feel safe and protected, Wangji’s tiny body secure in his arms.</p><p>Though Lan Huan’s brother grew out of the habit in less than a year, Lan Huan himself has never quite managed to avoid gravitating towards anyone else who shares his bed. There haven’t been many, and all of them objected to being clung to in their sleep.</p><p>But Lan Huan wasn’t kicked awake (which is how he’s used to being woken up when he turns into a limpet like this). Instead, he slept peacefully, dreamlessly, and came awake in a slow rise out of sleep, wrapped around the man he loves. Something in Lan Huan’s chest is sweet and soft. He is so, so grateful to be allowed this much.</p><p>But then he remembers where he is. He remembers last night, the tears and the confessions. He remembers that Jiang Wanyin doesn’t love him back.</p><p>Lan Huan is very much awake now, but a part of him – a weak part – wishes he wasn’t. Awareness tastes bitter, like medicine. Lan Huan has never liked medicine all that much, but he takes it when he has to.</p><p>He withdraws his arms from around Jiang Wanyin, who shivers a bit when the cold air hits the places where Lan Huan’s warmth was only seconds before. But the younger man doesn’t wake.</p><p>A feeling bubbles up in him, an urge to say something.</p><p>“I think I love you,” Lan Huan whispers when he can’t take it anymore. The words spill out and hang in the air, a confession of his own. He feels naked, although Jiang Wanyin is too far unconscious to hear it.</p><p>“I love you,” he says again. It settles over him like a fine layer of dust he can’t shake off. Jiang Wanyin says nothing, only shifts so his hair falls on the pillow, leaving his face bare. His mouth is slack with sleep.</p><p>Lan Huan wants to kiss him so badly. He catches himself leaning forward and immediately feels shame well up in his stomach.</p><p><em>He doesn’t want you</em>, he tells himself. <em>He’s never kissed anyone before. His first time should be with someone special. Not you.</em></p><p>It’s no good. Lan Huan still wants it. Is this what Wangji felt like, he wonders, pining after Wei Wuxian all those years? The man he loved never noticing, never sparing a glance his way, never stopping to think that maybe the man who was offering to take him home really wanted to build a home with him. It hurts.</p><p>It hurts to want Jiang Wanyin, but Lan Huan wants him anyway. He understands now, what Wangji said the last time he came to visit. About love being worth it, even with the fear.</p><p>Lan Huan doesn’t just want Jiang Wanyin’s first kiss; he wants his everything. He wants his tears and his secrets; his tiny smiles and the laughter he lets out when he forgets to be self-conscious; his bad temper and the way he crosses his arms and sniffs when Lan Huan tells a bad joke. He wants what he thought he had in the space between sleeping and waking, when the last thing he saw the night before was the other man’s face, and the first thing he noticed in the morning was the faint scent of the oil Jiang Wanyin uses on his hair.</p><p>But Lan Huan doesn’t say any of that. He’s a coward, he knows, but he doesn’t want to ruin what they have. Friendship is better than nothing at all. Instead, he reaches out and gently shakes the younger sect leader awake.</p><p>“Good morning,” he says, when Jiang Wanyin blinks open bleary eyes. The sky outside is the greyish half-light of false dawn. It will be bright soon. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I got run over by a horde of fierce corpses, bashed in the head and left out to dry in the sun for an afternoon.”</p><p>The other man presses a hand to his temple, and summarises his previous statement in two words: “like shit.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin sits up. His hair spills like water down his back, and for the first time, Lan Huan notices it’s <em>curled</em>. Parts of Jiang Wanyin’s hair are in waves, others in ringlets, strands falling in spirals over his shoulder.</p><p>The other man notices Lan Huan looking and frowns. “It’s a mess, I know,” he says apologetically. “It gets like this in the mornings if I don’t brush it enough the night before.”</p><p>His hair <em>is</em> a mess. Lan Huan nearly has to sit on his hands to keep from touching it.</p><p>“Do you remember anything from last night?”, he ventures cautiously.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin combs his fingers through his hair, unwinding the curls, and snorts. “How could I forget?”</p><p>Well, there’s that. At least Lan Huan managed to wake up before him, avoiding what could have been a very embarrassing situation. He’s thankful for that, at least.</p><p>Part of him is glad that Jiang Wanyin remembers what happened last night, that out of all people, of everywhere he could have gone, he came to find Lan Huan. Selfishly, he holds on to the happiness that brings him.</p><p>“And what you promised? Do you remember that?”</p><p>“I didn’t promise anything,” says the younger man. “But what you said...I’ll try.”</p><p>He stops short. A hint of colour is rising to his cheeks. “Would you– would you be there? When I talk to them?”</p><p><em>Still?</em> After last night, after everything, Lan Huan had thought that Jiang Wanyin would regret what he told him. Would wake up and realise that it was all a mistake, that he’d never intended to trust Lan Huan to begin with.</p><p>Now, a familiar feeling takes root in Lan Huan’s chest. The same one he’d had when Jiang Wanyin asked him to stay with him, wine-sodden and half-asleep, eyes swollen from crying.</p><p>“Why?”, asks Lan Huan, just because it might be too good to be true.</p><p>“I– I don’t quite trust myself not to fuck it up. And I don’t want to anymore.”</p><p>Lan Huan swallows, his throat suddenly dry. “I trust you.”</p><p>It’s true, and he doesn’t miss the way Jiang Wanyin’s eyes dart away from him, looking to his hands, the floor, anywhere else.</p><p>“But if that’s what you want, I’ll be there. If that’s what you need.”</p>

    <p>Jin Ling wakes when Sizhui gently shakes him awake, his head pillowed on Sizhui’s chest, nice and comfy and decidedly the best place to be at the moment.</p><p>He opens his eyes and immediately regrets it; they’re swollen and gummy, and he can barely lift his lids halfway up. He grumbles at Sizhui’s efforts to wake him up, but his own efforts to roll over and go back to sleep are met with resistance.</p><p>“It’s time to get up,” Sizhui says. Despite having only just woken up, Sizhui is perfectly presentable. His forehead ribbon is tied neatly, his robes are uncreased and he doesn’t have so much as a hair out of place.</p><p>“Shut up,” Jin Ling mutters, but sits up anyway.</p><p>It wasn’t noticeable at first, with Jin Ling’s mind still only half-conscious, but there’s a whuffling sound coming from the other side of the room. Jin Ling looks in that direction and sees Wei Wuxian’s sleeping form, curled up on a comfortable-looking chair only a few feet away. He’s snoring, of course.</p><p>Jin Ling rubs at his eyes, grimacing when they feel hot. That’s what he gets for crying, he guesses; Jiu-jiu always told him not to do it. <em>You’re like your Niang,</em> he said once. <em>She couldn’t cry for five minutes without everyone knowing about it the next day because of how red her eyes would be.</em></p><p>Jiu-jiu…</p><p>Suddenly, even though Jin Ling’s tear ducts are sore and running on empty, he feels like crying again.</p><p>Last night, after Jin Ling grabbed Sizhui and fled his uncle’s room, he stood in a corridor far away from everything and couldn’t stop sobbing. Sizhui, whose own cheeks were tear-streaked as well, took his hand and led him to the <em>jingshi</em>. His parents’ house.</p><p>The rest of the night was a blur, but Jin Ling recalls Wei Wuxian emerging from the <em>jingshi</em> and seeing the two of them standing there on the doorstep. He ushered them inside and got the full story out of them, and when he’d finally heard it, his face turned pale and ashen gray.</p><p>Hanguang-Jun came out into the living room then, expression thunderous and looking like he was going to kill someone. Preferably Jin Ling’s uncle. And Sizhui tried to smile and say that everything was fine and he wasn’t worth all that fuss, which sent Wei Wuxian into a lecture about self-esteem and <em>you need to learn to value yourself more, Sizhui</em>, and Jin Ling into paroxysms of guilt for getting both of them into this situation.</p><p>After that, well, once Wei Wuxian caught wind of Jin Ling’s shame and self-loathing, he’d pounced on a new target and proceeded to give a speech about how <em>it wasn’t your fault, Jin Ling, so don’t think of it that way</em>. Then he said that they’d deal with it in the morning and told both teenagers to sleep on his couch.</p><p>In the light of the morning, the situation doesn’t look much better. Wei Wuxian is…alright as an uncle, Jin Ling supposes, but it isn’t the same. Which sounds ridiculous, seeing as the man who raised him is terrible at comforting people, but right now, all Jin Ling can think about is his Jiu-jiu.</p><p>He doesn’t give speeches and yells too much – which almost always makes everything worse – but whenever Jin Ling is really, really down, he’ll wake up to a bowl of soup on his bedside table, pork ribs and lotus root floating on the surface, and the servants bustling through the corridors, rags in hand and heads bowed. Muttering darkly about the Sect Leader making a mess in the kitchen.</p><p>Wei Wuxian can’t cook for shit. It makes Jin Ling feel hollow inside.</p><p>Sizhui stands up and walks to where Wei Wuxian is still sleeping, mouth open and probably drooling all over his arm where his cheek is resting on it. He lays a hand on his father and shakes him gently, much the same as he did to Jin Ling.</p><p>“Senior Wei,” he says politely. Jin Ling’s never understood that. He and Sizhui are both orphans, but if he ever met his own father, he’d be calling ‘<em>Ah-Die</em>’ left and right. His father would probably get sick of his own title with how often Jin Ling would say it.</p><p>Wei Wuxian doesn’t stir. Jin Ling stalks over and pokes him hard in the arm.</p><p>“Wake up, you lazy old man.” He manages a smirk when Sizhui gives him a disapproving look. <em>Nephew privileges</em>, Jin Ling thinks, as smugly as he can.</p><p>“’M only thirty-five.” Jin Ling’s other uncle comes awake with a protest. Figures that would do it. “And I spent thirteen years dead, so I’m technically only twenty-two.”</p><p>Hanguang-Jun enters the room, teapot in hand. He gracefully sets it down on the table and proceeds to produce four cups, seemingly out of nowhere. Jin Ling eyes him balefully. He still hasn’t warmed up to the Second Jade of Gusu yet.</p><p>The only real adult in the house – in Jin Ling’s opinion – makes his way over to his husband and sits down beside him, again gracefully. “Not a joke.”</p><p>His words are reproachful, but his tone is mild. Still, Wei Wuxian pats his hand in apology. “Sorry, Lan Zhan. Force of habit.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>He sits up with a yawn, grabbing Hanguang-Jun’s collar and kissing him full on the mouth. Jin Ling looks away in disgust. But then Wei Wuxian pulls back and abruptly turns serious.</p><p>“About what you two told us last night–” He cuts himself off when Hanguang-Jun’s expression goes stony. Well, stonier than usual. They have a silent conversation with their eyes, following which Hanguang-Jun lets out a sigh and looks at the floor.</p><p>“As I was saying, I need to talk to my brother.”</p><p>“Please,” Sizhui says, his eyes downcast, “not on my account.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian gives him a meaningful look. “Honestly, you’re as bad as Lan Zhan. No – this has gone on long enough. I’m not letting him treat you like this.”</p><p>Jin Ling bites his lip. Last night, he tried so <em>hard</em>. He begged and pleaded, and it still wasn’t enough. How is Wei Wuxian going to get Uncle to listen?</p><p>(And if he does, what does that say about Jin Ling?)</p><p>“Hey.” Jin Ling hears Wei Wuxian’s voice, suddenly gentle. “It’s not as impossible as you think. He’ll see reason, I know it.”</p><p>“How can you be sure?”</p><p>“I know Jiang Cheng.” Wei Wuxian pauses, obviously choosing his words with care. “I know this doesn’t sound good, but if this had happened thirteen years ago, he would have killed you, Sizhui. It wouldn’t have mattered that you’re my son, or that you and Jin Ling are together; he was too far gone.”</p><p>“But yesterday, even with everything he said, he never touched you. It doesn’t make it okay – in fact, I’m going to yell at him about it – but it means there’s still hope. He’ll come around, you’ll see.”</p><p>Jin Ling’s eyes are stinging again. The look on Hanguang-Jun’s face is far from pleasant, but it fades when Wei Wuxian takes his hand and twines their fingers together.</p><p>“I can’t give up on him.” He directs this bit to his husband, but both Jin Ling and Sizhui hear it loud and clear. “He’s my baby brother.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Jin Ling can’t decipher jack shit from that, but Wei Wuxian’s face relaxes, some of the tension leaving his body. He smiles.</p><p>For the first time, Jin Ling sees in him something other than the Yiling Patriarch, or the clown who chases donkeys all over the Cloud Recesses and has allegedly shaved off Lan Qiren’s goatee at least once. He’s never been able to think of Jiu-jiu as anyone’s ‘baby anything’, but now, Jin Ling wonders what it must be like to have an older brother like Wei Wuxian.</p><p>He never reaches a conclusion on that, because a knock comes at the door, drawing the attention of all four people in the room.</p><p>“Come in, it’s unlocked,” calls Wei Wuxian. Utterly heedless of any security whatsoever. It’s a miracle he hasn’t yet been killed a second time.</p><p>The door opens, and Zewu-Jun steps through. Jin Ling’s jaw drops, as does Sizhui’s. No one has seen Sect Leader Lan in a year, apart from his close family here in Cloud Recesses and apparently, Jin Ling’s uncle. Who is, at this moment, entering the living room just behind him.</p><p>Jin Ling takes the opportunity to look him up and down. His uncle looks surprisingly put-together, for someone who was raging and screaming only hours before. His back is stiff and he’s looking straight ahead. It’s only the slight redness at the rims of the man’s eyes that suggests that last night for him might have been anywhere close to the hell it was for his nephew.</p><p>Sect Leader Lan greets his brother and brother-in-law, then turns to Sizhui and Jin Ling. He addresses them by name, and adds, “I thought we might find you here.”</p><p>
  <em>We? What ‘we’?</em>
</p><p>Unsurprisingly, while Jin Ling is still goggling, Sizhui takes the lead. “Zewu-Jun, Sect Leader Jiang. Good morning.”</p><p>The taller of the two smiles back at them, then takes a step back to stand behind Uncle, who fixes his gaze squarely on Jin Ling.</p><p>“I…came to talk to you. About what happened last night.” The words are halting, awkward, and Jin Ling inhales sharply. Hanguang-Jun just glares. But Uncle isn’t angry – just quiet. If Jin Ling didn’t know better, he’d think the man was nervous.</p><p>Sizhui seems to catch on to what he’s feeling, and quietly asks his parents to leave the room. Jin Ling is so fucking grateful, because as it is, he feels like they’re standing on two opposite sides of a battlefield: Wei Wuxian and Hanguang-Jun on one, Uncle and Sect Leader Lan on the other. And him and Sizhui in the centre, the thing they’re fighting over. Jin Ling doesn’t want them to fight. He doesn’t want to feel like this anymore.</p><p>Once the two men leave the room, Jin Ling turns to Zewu-Jun and asks, as politely as he can, what the Lan sect leader is doing here.</p><p>“Moral support,” he replies with a placid smile. He moves backwards a few more steps to stand unobtrusively against the wall. Jin Ling almost raises an eyebrow at his uncle, then catches himself with the reminder that he can’t do that right now.</p><p>Then he hears Jiu-jiu’s quiet voice.</p><p>“Sect Leader Lan is here because last night, I…” He trails off, ducking his head as if ashamed. Jin Ling has never seen him do that. Jiu-jiu is proud, always; what does he have to be ashamed of?</p><p>He regains his voice. “Last night, I lost control. I lashed out at you, Jin Ling, and at Young Master Lan. I hurt you both, with my words, as well as my actions. I came here today to apologise, but I…don’t want to hurt you again. Either of you.”</p><p>Something in Jin Ling’s chest tightens.</p><p>“Why?” His voice cracks. “Why did you say all those awful things to Sizhui?” <em>And to me</em>, he doesn’t say.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Ah-Ling.”</p><p>Why is Uncle apologising? He never apologises. Not to Jin Ling, not to anyone. And he hasn’t called Jin Ling by that name in years, not since before he turned twelve and became too old to be a child anymore, with a child’s name. Jin Ling’s nose begins to sting along with his eyes.</p><p>“But <em>why</em>, Uncle? Sizhui isn’t a monster; he’s <em>not</em>. Why would you say he is? Why would you say he deserves to–”</p><p>Jin Ling stops himself before he can finish that sentence. The very thought is unforgivable. He can’t say it aloud. Then a strong, warm hand slips into his. Of course it’s Sizhui, <em>of course</em>. Always giving comfort when he’s the one most in need of it.</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry.” Uncle pinches the bridge of his nose like he’s holding back a sneeze. But when he looks up, his eyes shine more than they should. “I just– I couldn’t stop, after all these years. What they did, I couldn’t let it go. I couldn’t forget; I couldn’t forgive.”</p><p>When Jin Ling finally speaks, his voice is hoarse. “And what did they do, Uncle? You never told me.”</p><p>It’s the truth. Jiu-jiu never has. All he’s ever said to Jin Ling is that his boyfriend’s family is the reason he’s an orphan. The reason his parents and grandparents are dead. But never how.</p><p>At his uncle’s silence, Jin Ling dares to beg. “Please,” he says.</p><p>“Torture. That was the least of their crimes. For the rest, murder. They killed everyone in Lotus Pier and burned the bodies in the courtyard. Wei Wuxian and I were the only ones to survive. We watched.”</p><p>Sizhui’s face pales at the description of his birth sect’s crimes. All his life – all both of their lives – they’ve only heard about the evils of the Wen sect, their character painted in broad, ugly strokes. But never the details of the evils they committed.</p><p>Jin Ling is watching his Jiu-jiu too. The blandness of his voice, the way his mouth hangs, expressionless. The quiet, yet attentive manner of Sect Leader Lan in the background, barely even reacting to his words. It is the truth.</p><p>Not that Jin Ling ever thought his uncle was lying. But sometime in his sixth year, when he heard Jiu-jiu repeat his tirade against the Wens for the umpteenth time, he began to think he was exaggerating. Just a bit, for the drama. After all, they couldn’t possibly be responsible for all the awful things in the world the way Jiu-jiu always said.</p><p>“But it’s not your fault, is it, Lan Sizhui?” A hint of bitterness surfaces in his voice, yet it’s surprisingly gentle. Gentler than Jin Ling has heard from Uncle in years. “Ah-Ling was right; you weren’t there. You didn’t do anything. I shouldn’t have blamed you for it. I– I’m sorry.”</p><p>Sizhui nods. “It’s all right, Sect Leader Jiang.” Then he stops for a moment, unsure of how to proceed. “I…accept your apology.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Jin Ling’s uncle turns back to face him again. “Ah-Ling–”</p><p>Jin Ling gives up on being strong. If Jiu-jiu is going to call him by his childhood name, he’s damn well going to be a child. He lets go of Sizhui’s hand with a cry and throws himself at his uncle like he’s five years old again.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he whispers over and over, clinging to Jiu-jiu’s waist and sobbing into the front of his robes. Jiu-jiu’s arms come up to encircle him, while he lays one of his hands over the top of Jin Ling’s hair. He doesn’t say anything, and so maybe he doesn’t know what Jin Ling is apologising for.</p><p>Jin Ling does. For those last, angry words he yelled at his uncle last night.</p><p>
  <em>You’re not my father!</em>
</p><p>But he says “I’m sorry” instead, because he doesn’t know how to say <em>you’re the closest thing I’ve ever had</em>.</p><p>The hand on his head moves in slow circles, and maybe Jiu-jiu hears the thought screaming inside his head, because finally, he says, “it’s all right.”</p><p>“So am I.”</p>

    <p>It’s maybe another half-hour before Jin Ling’s tears finally stop coming. Jiu-jiu holds him through it, until the embarrassment of bawling like a month-old infant finally catches up to him and Jin Ling pulls away.</p><p>He gets back to his feet, eyeing the massive wet spot on the front of Jiu-jiu’s robes rather shamefully, but Sizhui doesn’t say anything when he returns to his side. Just slips his hand back into Jin Ling’s like it’s where it belongs.</p><p>Jiu-jiu stands up as well. His eyes are suspiciously bright; Jin Ling is glad to know he wasn’t the only one affected. He hasn’t cried like that since – well, <em>ever</em>, probably. He’d been so worried that he’d fucked everything up, terrified that Uncle was never going to talk to him again.</p><p>It’s been just the two of them for so long; Jin Ling doesn’t know what he would do if that happened.</p><p>Now, the sheer relief that it isn’t the case is enough to make his knees go weak. He hopes that Sizhui doesn’t notice that Jin Ling is clinging hard to his hand, as much to stay upright as for comfort. If he does notice, he doesn’t comment.</p><p>Then Jiu-jiu’s voice cuts through the soft sounds of the hitched breaths that Jin Ling hasn’t yet managed to calm.</p><p>“I’m proud of you, Ah-Ling.”</p><p>Jin Ling freezes. Turns watery eyes up to look at his uncle. Jiu-jiu is only a few inches taller than he is now; Jin Ling remembers having to crane his neck just to look him in the eyes.</p><p>It’s not something he has heard often in his sixteen years of life. Maybe ever. It’s all he can remember wanting since he was old enough to know what it meant. Why is he hearing it now? Now, of all times?</p><p>“Your <em>Die</em> and <em>Niang</em> would be too.” Uncle’s voice is hoarse, like the words are shattered glass dragging along his throat.</p><p>Jin Ling’s breath catches. He’s not blind; he’s known for years that it hurts Uncle to talk about his parents. It’s why he almost never brings them up, even though he <em>aches</em> to know more. His mother’s favourite colour, the way she did her hair, if she could sing; whether his father was good at archery, and how well he could ride a horse.</p><p>It makes the little he does know about them inconceivably precious, tiny treasures he guards jealously inside his heart. The soup that used to be his mother’s specialty, that Uncle now makes on his birthday. The knowledge that Jin Ling cries just like she did. That his father lost his shit and ran away right after he confessed his feelings to her. His heroicism in the <em>Xuanwu</em> cave.</p><p>It’s stupid that Jin Ling has always wanted to make them proud too, those two strangers who share his face. But he wants it – wants it nearly as much as he wants his uncle’s acknowledgement.</p><p>He’s always wanted to be a hero like his <em>Die</em>. To be kind and good like his <em>Niang</em>. But Jin Ling knows he isn’t. Nearly everyone he’s ever met has said his mother birthed him but didn’t raise him – which is the truth, but what’s another child orphaned by the war? – or some variation of that much-beloved phrase.</p><p>As much as Jin Ling wants to be like his parents, he’s never known them. He doesn’t know enough about them to tell if they’d be proud of him or not. But his uncle does, and now he’s telling him they would be. That’s another thing Jin Ling has always yearned to hear.</p><p>He presses a fist to his mouth. He won’t cry again; he <em>won’t</em>.</p><p>“Thank you,” he whispers. It’s all he says, because he can’t get anything else past the lump that has abruptly up and formed in his throat.</p><p>Jiu-jiu steps backward. Sect Leader Lan takes a step forward at the same time. And suddenly, they’re standing almost side by side, though Jin Ling’s uncle is still slightly in front.</p><p>Jin Ling squeezes Sizhui’s hand, and Sizhui says quietly, “I’ll get Hanguang-Jun and Senior Wei now.”</p><p>He gets a nod of assent and turns to go. It’s then that Jiu-jiu makes the same movement: a half-turn towards the door. <em>He’s leaving?</em></p><p>But no – Sect Leader Lan reaches out and sets a hand on Uncle’s shoulder. Jin Ling tenses. Sect leader or no, Zewu-Jun is probably going to lose that hand. Too bad; Jin Ling had actually kind of liked Zewu-Jun. He’d seemed nice.</p><p>Yet there’s no ring of steel that means Jiu-jiu has drawn Sandu, or crackle of violet sparks from Zidian. Jiu-jiu does nothing. In fact, he stops moving entirely.</p><p>Sect Leader Lan gives him a look that Jin Ling can’t decipher, and Jiu-jiu’s expression turns ugly. Sizhui has paused in his endeavour, and is now standing quietly behind Jin Ling, just watching. Neither of the two sect leaders seem to notice.</p><p>“No,” says Uncle. His tone is frigid, sending a shiver down Jin Ling’s spine even though he has no fucking clue what they’re talking about. But Sect Leader Lan is unaffected.</p><p>“You promised.”</p><p><em>What?</em> And again, <em>huh?</em></p><p>The two of them stare at each other for a long moment. It looks like they’re having the same kind of silent conversation that Jin Ling saw this morning between Wei Wuxian and Hanguang-Jun. Then Jiu-jiu’s face crumples and he looks away with a defeated sigh.</p><p>Jin Ling gapes. Is Uncle actually <em>giving in</em> to Sect Leader Lan? In what looks like an argument?</p><p>“I can’t,” he says, and Jin Ling’s jaw falls even further open. He sounds so sad. So desperate; like he’s begging. <em>Uncle, beg?</em> “Not now. I can’t do it.”</p><p>Sect Leader Lan seems to have forgotten that his nephew and Jin Ling are still in the room. He takes Uncle’s hand. Jin Ling’s brain shorts out from the overload of strangeness. Is this a dream? Has he hit his head? Has he died and been reincarnated in an alternate reality? One where Uncle is…not Uncle, and doesn’t slap people’s hands away hard enough to break their fingers when they touch him without warning?</p><p>“You can.” Zewu-Jun’s voice is soft and encouraging, like he’s coaxing a wild animal. “Go talk to your brother, Wanyin. Tell him.”</p><p>Tell him what? And did Sect Leader Lan just call Jiu-jiu <em>Wanyin</em>? Jin Ling decides he’s going to stop asking questions before his brain explodes. In fact, he’s just going to go with it. He is calm. He is unaffected. Nothing can faze him.</p><p>…</p><p>...</p><p>...</p><p>
  <em>WHAT THE FUCK?!</em>
</p><p>But Uncle is completely oblivious to his nephew’s impending mental breakdown. He seems to gather himself, draws up a little straighter, and squares his shoulders.</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>And then, not even looking at the two gaping teenagers, he marches out of the living room, pulls open the door to where Wei Wuxian and his husband are, and disappears inside. Sect Leader Lan follows, also sparing no glances for Jin Ling and Sizhui.</p><p>Which Jin Ling is completely fine with. He needs a moment to process this. Beside him, Sizhui looks equally shell-shocked.</p><p>“What just happened?”</p><p>The sound of his boyfriend’s voice jolts him out of his stupor. Okay, Jin Ling has had his moment. He can deal with this. Absolutely. He shrugs.</p><p>“No idea,” he replies, and goes to listen at the keyhole. Which turns out to be a not-so-great idea, because he can’t hear anything whatsoever. And the door is closed, too, so he can’t even peek inside.</p><p>He feels Sizhui’s eyes on him. Jin Ling looks up, and meets Sizhui’s gaze, intense as ever.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“Trying to hear what’s going on.” Jin Ling strains his ears, but gets nothing. The door seems to be ungodly thick. Which makes <em>no</em> sense whatsoever, seeing as this is a house shared by a single married couple who are within three feet of each other at all times.</p><p>Sizhui pauses to consider this. Then he grabs Jin Ling’s arm.</p><p>“Follow me,” he says. Jin Ling trusts him, so he doesn’t put up a fight when he leads him out the door and round the back of the <em>jingshi</em>. There’s a window there, above a sill, that looks into a room that looks like a rather ordinary study. Their uncles are in there – Jin Ling can see from the glimpses of fabric. Black, white and purple.</p><p>Sizhui puts a finger to his lips. The two of them ease under the sill. It’s a tight fit, but they make it work. More importantly, if Jin Ling leans outwards ever so slightly and back, he can both see and hear everything happening inside the room.</p><p>“They always forget to close the window,” whispers Sizhui.</p><p>“I’m glad your parents are idiots,” says Jin Ling, out loud this time. He shuts up at Sizhui’s subsequent glare, and quietly gets into position to snoop. He almost wishes Jingyi were here.</p><p>Inside, his two uncles seem to be having some sort of standoff. Both of them are facing each other, jaws set and faces drawn and pale. The two Lan brothers are standing somewhere in the background, ready – it looks like – to pull them apart if this turns into a fight.</p><p>Jin Ling sincerely hopes it doesn’t.</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s voice drifts through the open window. It is tired, weary. Not a standoff, then. A…talk, of some sort.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have said those things. You hurt Ah-Yuan. And Jin Ling.”</p><p>“I know.” Uncle sounds equally tired, but his face is near-expressionless. It’s almost as good a mask as Hanguang-Jun’s. Still, Jin Ling grew up with his Jiu-jiu’s moods as his constant companions, the same as other children had playmates. He recognises the slight flicker of emotion in his eyes.</p><p>“I told you years ago that you needed to stop hating. To let go and move on. You haven’t.”</p><p>“I know.” The flicker is back again. Brighter this time. Jin Ling still can’t tell what it is. but he doesn’t think it’s dangerous.</p><p>“The war is over, Jiang Cheng.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I’m not sure you do.” Wei Wuxian tries to gentle his words, keeping his tone soft, but Jin Ling can see Jiu-jiu recoil. “I know what they did to you – Wen Chao and the others. But it’s been seventeen years, and it still lives in your heart.”</p><p>Jiu-jiu is fighting to keep his calm now. It’s obvious, from the way his hands are clenched into fists at his sides. Zidian is glowing, only a hair’s breadth from spitting sparks.</p><p>“It’s hurting you; I can see it. I’m worried about you.”</p><p>Jin Ling sees too. He sees the exact moment Jiu-jiu snaps. But it’s not the kind of breaking Jin Ling has grown accustomed to throughout his childhood: a hot flare and the shattering of wood. Shrapnel flying outwards.</p><p>No, this is different. This time, the flare is cold, and the splinters burst inwards instead. Jiu-jiu’s composure cracks, the way the iced-over surface of a pond does when someone heavy steps on it. But he doesn’t fly into a rage. Instead, he sags. A puppet with its strings cut.</p><p>“I’m tired, Wei Wuxian. I’ve made my apologies to the children; I’ll deal with the war on my own. Let me just say what I came here to say, and then I’ll leave.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian is dumbstruck. Doubtless, like Jin Ling, he’d expected his brother to begin yelling the moment he lost his cool.</p><p><em>I’m tired</em>. It’s not something Jin Ling has ever heard out of his Jiu-jiu’s mouth. That, and <em>I’m sorry</em>.</p><p>The shorter man’s mouth opens and closes a few times, but no sound comes out. Finally, he seems to get his shit together enough to ask, “what did you want, then, if it wasn’t to get yelled at by me?”</p><p>He gives a feeble attempt at one of his trademark grins, obviously trying to lighten the mood. Jin Ling winces despite himself; that is <em>not</em> the smartest move right now. Or particularly well-executed. He half-expects Jiu-jiu to finally lose it and whack him with Zidian, thereby siccing Hanguang-Jun on himself and causing the whole room to devolve into chaos, but his uncle just shuts his eyes briefly.</p><p>“Just to tell you something. It’s not particularly important, but you probably deserve to know.”</p><p>The stupid grin is wiped off of Wei Wuxian’s face almost immediately, to be replaced by a look of worry. “What is it? You’re not dying, are you? Holy shit, please don’t be dying.”</p><p>“I’m not dying.” Uncle tilts his gaze skywards, as if begging the heavens to give him strength. “That would be relatively important, don’t you think? Imbecile.”</p><p>“Thank the gods. You know, you really had me scared there for a second–”</p><p>“<em>Wei Wuxian</em>.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Then, gentle again, the same tone as before. “What did you want to tell me, Jiang Cheng?”</p><p>Jiu-jiu’s hand goes to Zidian, twisting it around his finger. His knuckles are white. Jin Ling tenses, and sees his other uncle do the same. A sense of dread fills him. Nothing good ever happens when Jiu-jiu reaches for his ring.</p><p>He is quiet for a while. When he speaks, his voice is nearly as quiet.</p><p>“Do you remember the day after the massacre at Lotus Pier?”</p><p>Jin Ling’s eyebrows shoot up, and Wei Wuxian looks puzzled. Clearly, whatever he’d been expecting, it wasn’t that.</p><p>“I could never forget,” he answers.</p><p>“Do you remember when we walked all night to reach that village, then after we got there, you left to buy us food?”</p><p>“I remember.”</p><p>“And when you came back, I wasn’t there. Do you remember that?”</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s mouth purses. He doesn’t seem to understand where this is going, but it doesn’t look like he likes it either. “My memory isn’t that bad. Of course I remember.”</p><p>Jiu-jiu’s eyelids slide closed again. This time, his head is cast down, towards the floor.</p><p>“When you found me, where was I?”</p><p>“Lotus Pier. In the armoury. Why, Jiang Cheng? What are you getting at?”</p><p>But Jiu-jiu ignores his question. He keeps on going. “Why was I there? Do you know why I went back?”</p><p>“To retrieve Uncle Jiang and Madam Yu’s bodies. To give them a proper burial. I know all this, and so do you. Tell me what this is really about.”</p><p>“Wrong.” Wei Wuxian’s head jerks up. His eyes go wide. “You’re wrong.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I didn’t go back for my parents’ corpses. I wasn’t stupid; I knew it wouldn’t do any good.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian is reeling, an incredulous expression on his face. Jin Ling isn’t sure what they’re talking about, but it doesn’t sound good. And with the picture Uncle painted before in the living room, he thinks he’s getting an idea of it.</p><p>“Then why? I thought–”</p><p>“You thought Wen Chao wouldn’t send anyone after us? Really? After he killed our <em>entire sect</em>? He knew we’d go to the village; you didn’t think he had people waiting there?”</p><p>“I–”</p><p>Uncle isn’t done talking. He starts again, and Wei Wuxian cuts himself off.</p><p>“I saw them after you left. They were everywhere, looking for us, and we were split up and you didn’t know. So I distracted them. Tried to, anyway; didn’t know if it would work. I hoped that I could make a big enough commotion that you’d notice, and I’d somehow manage to slip them and we could get the hell out of there.”</p><p>“But I fucked up. They caught me and dragged me back. And then, well, you know the rest.”</p><p>All the colour has drained from Wei Wuxian’s face. He looks as though he’s just had a rug ripped out from under him and is discovering that the floor is littered with broken glass.</p><p>“That’s it, I guess. I just wanted to tell you. And now you know.” Jiu-jiu’s expression is strange. Bland, as it’s been all through their conversation, but the edges of it have taken on a brittle quality. Like old paper, or clay baked too long in the oven.</p><p>Jin Ling thinks suddenly that anyone could peel it off – all of it. Just take it by the edge and lift it off him, like peeling a prawn out of its shell. He doesn’t know what he’d find under it, though. He’s not sure he wants to.</p><p>A choked sob escapes from Wei Wuxian’s throat. “Jiang Cheng, you–”</p><p>“Why<em>?</em> Your golden core– you let them– for me?” He sniffs, and a tear rolls down his cheek. Then another, and another. Faster and faster. Soon, he’s sobbing in earnest. His sentences are coming only in fragments, nearly impossible to understand. “He– they hurt you so badly. There was blood everywhere – Wen Qing almost couldn’t fix you.”</p><p>“Why?” And again, voice cracking. “<em>Why?</em>”</p><p>“To save you, you idiot.” Jiu-jiu’s breath hitches on the last word. His face is contorted, reddened. He looks…almost like Jin Ling does, when he’s trying his hardest not to cry. “I knew it would be worth it.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian wipes at his face and wails. “You dumb fuck! You weren’t supposed to– you were supposed to be my master. And I’d be your servant, remember? What kind of servant lets their master die for them?”</p><p>“You’re my fucking <em>brother</em>! I never saw you as my servant. <em>You</em> said that, not me.” Now Uncle’s face is wet as well. Seeing it, Jin Ling feels like crying too. “I’d have died for you – you and Ah-Jie both. You were all I had left.”</p><p>“All this time, I thought I’d sacrificed myself for you. My core for your life. Turns out you beat me there, huh?”</p><p>The shorter man sniffs again. “I beat you at everything else, too.”</p><p>“I take it back; I should have let them grab you.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian lets out an ugly, watery laugh, and Jin Ling’s two uncles fall into each other. The older brother curved around the younger, the younger wrapped up in the older’s smaller frame. Both of them clinging tight to each other, as if afraid the other might disappear for another thirteen years.</p><p>Jin Ling tears his gaze away from them. The moment feels too personal for him to watch. This isn’t a part of Jiu-jiu’s life he’s privy to; he shouldn’t pry. He’s done enough of that already.</p><p>Beside him, Sizhui meets his eyes, his lips half-curved.</p><p>“They need to communicate better,” he mouths.</p><p>Jin Ling elbows him in the side and smirks as Sizhui struggles to contain his yelp. But privately, he thinks to himself, <em>yeah. We really do.</em></p><p>“Let’s not keep secrets anymore,” he whispers back. His smirk turns to a real smile when Sizhui doesn’t retaliate and lays his head on his shoulder instead.</p><p>“No more secrets,” his boyfriend agrees.</p>

    <p>By the time Wei Ying and his brother are in a fit state to be seen by other people again, the atmosphere in the study has done a complete one-eighty. Warmed and melted, like a frigid ice block held over a flame until it turns to water.</p><p>When Jiang Cheng finally pulls away, Wei Ying is reluctant to let go. But his little brother has never been a tactile person, has never sought out physical contact the way Wei Ying does, and so he doesn’t protest. He lets Lan Zhan take his hand and pull him up off the floor, his knees groaning in protest at the sudden change in position after so long kneeling. Jiang Cheng gets up himself, though Wei Ying doesn’t miss the way his brother-in-law hovers behind him, willing to lend a hand should he need it.</p><p>So it’s true then. His little brother and his elder brother-in-law. That was actually…not something Wei Ying saw coming. They’re complete polar opposites, really, like fire and water, able to coexist in the same area, but not to mesh. Ever.</p><p>But stranger things have happened. And when Jiang Cheng came to talk to him about Lan Xichen just a couple days ago, Wei Ying could <em>hear</em> the concern in his voice. Concern he’s only ever heard for Ah-Jie, Jin Ling, and on occasion, when Jiang Cheng lets his guard down, Wei Ying himself.</p><p>Still, there’s a vast difference between inferring something based on the way Jiang Cheng’s voice softens when he talks about the other sect leader, and actually seeing them together. It’s kind of sweet, actually, how his brother’s stance opens up so he’s shoulder-to-shoulder with Lan Xichen. And how Lan Xichen watches him when Jiang Cheng’s looking in the other direction.</p><p>It’s the same look he’s caught Lan Zhan giving him more than once – the times he feels eyes on him and whips his head around too fast for Lan Zhan to get properly embarrassed and look away. It must be a Lan thing, to stare acutely at the object of one’s affections, only when they’re unaware of it. Jiang Cheng certainly isn’t noticing.</p><p>In fact, Wei Ying is willing to bet Lan Zhan’s entire savings that Lan Xichen is in love with his baby brother, and Jiang Cheng, the dumbass, doesn’t even know it.</p><p>(Wei Ying conveniently ignores the one and a half decades he spent oblivious to the love of his life silently pining after him.)</p><p>That’s what seals it for Wei Ying. With his relationship with his brother now at an all-time high, it’s time to step fully back into his role as elder sibling. Jiang Cheng has been alone for far too long; Wei Ying would be a <em>terrible</em> older brother if he let him die lonely and unattached. And a virgin.</p><p>(He’s pretty sure about that last one, even though he’s been dead for thirteen of the past fourteen years so it’s not quite safe to bet. He won’t tell Jiang Cheng, though. He’d rather not taste Zidian’s sting again in this lifetime, thank you very much.)</p><p>Frankly, it’s his duty to do this. For the good of the family, and the good of his thickheaded, oblivious little brother. Absolutely.</p><p>So when Jiang Cheng finally leaves the <em>jingshi</em>, followed by Jin Ling and Sizhui – despite their way-too-innocent faces, Wei Ying has a sneaking suspicion they were listening in on <em>everything</em>, the little brats – and then Lan Xichen, Wei Ying grabs the Lan sect leader by the arm and asks him to stay behind. No, ‘asks’ might be too mild a word. ‘Demands’ is better.</p><p>Lan Xichen has no choice but to acquiesce. At that, Jiang Cheng pauses in his tracks and asks what it is they’re talking about. Wei Ying gets only a bland look from his brother-in-law, as if to say <em>I’m fulfilling your request here; you answer the questions.</em></p><p>Wei Ying gives a tight smile instead. “I’d like to ask Sect Leader Lan about a few things. Cultivation techniques, you know.”</p><p>He shrugs and glances down at Mo Xuanyu’s body to really sell it. His unfortunate host, while still alive, had the figure of a stick insect, due to years of malnourishment and neglect. He’s got some degree of musculature now, of course, but he still misses his old body on occasion. Jiang Cheng raises his eyebrow, but leaves.</p><p>Now it’s just him and the twin Jades of Gusu. Scratch that – just the elder Jade; sometime in the past five minutes, Lan Zhan has disappeared into thin air. Wei Ying suppresses a sigh. His husband’s absence will undoubtedly make this easier, but at the same time, he can’t help but want him here.</p><p>Lan Xichen seats himself on the mats on the living room floor. He’s graceful too, elegant just like Lan Zhan. They have the same noble, handsome features – high cheekbones and thick, sweeping lashes – but the elder brother’s are softened by the slight smile he always wears. It’s a pleasing effect – don’t get him wrong, Lan Xichen is an attractive man – but in Wei Ying’s (completely unbiased) opinion, Lan Zhan is way better-looking.</p><p>Sweet, too, in his silence, the way he ponders every word before he says it. The way he only smiles with his eyes, unless the two of them are alone. Lan Xichen’s smile is nice to look at, but it feels almost detached, just another way of holding people at a distance. Lan Zhan is far more direct about it, which is one of the things Wei Ying adores about him.</p><p>Wei Ying sits down too. He does not pour tea.</p><p>“I take it we’re not actually discussing cultivation techniques,” Lan Xichen says. He’s folded his hands across his lap. The very picture of calm, but Wei Ying thinks he can detect a hint of nervousness there.</p><p>“No, we’re not.” Wei Ying, of course, is completely at ease. After all, this is his house.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>What kind of response is that? Come on, at least give him something to work with. He and Lan Xichen sit in silence for a while. Wei Ying fidgets with the hem of his robes. He’s never been very good at staying still.</p><p>Finally, Lan Xichen opens his mouth again.</p><p>“Where’s Wangji?”</p><p>“Conflict of interest,” Wei Ying replies.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p><em>Of course</em>. The ex-Yiling Patriarch suppresses an eye roll. Of course he doesn’t get it – no, that would be too easy. He’s going to have to spell it out for him.</p><p>He returns Lan Xichen’s placid smile with one of his own and sets his elbows on his knees, leaning forward.</p><p>“Let me put this plainly,” he says. “This is an interrogation. Here is how this is going to work: I’m going to ask as many questions as I want, and you’re going to sit here and answer them. Lan Zhan isn’t here because you’re his brother and he doesn’t want to take sides, so I kicked him out of the house for an hour or two.”</p><p>Wei Ying’s grin widens and he rubs his hands together like a trashy novel villain. “In that time, you’re all mine.”</p><p>Okay, perhaps that wasn’t the most intimidating thing to do. It may possibly be the <em>least</em> intimidating thing he could have done.</p><p><em>Dangit</em>, thinks Wei Ying as Lan Xichen’s previous nerves vanish and he immediately looks more at ease. He looks, actually, like he’s about a hair’s breadth away from laughing at him. That was not supposed to happen. Still, he’s worked with less.</p><p>(Though his intimidating older brother techniques may be just a teeny bit less effective when pitted against another intimidating older brother. And honestly, after Wei Ying was subjected to the other man’s interrogation on Lan Zhan’s behalf last year, he’s not sure he can top that. Nobody can top that.)</p><p>“Well then, I’ll do my very best to be of use to you,” Lan Xichen replies politely. Wei Ying’s eyes narrow. The Lan sect leader is so nice, so very <em>polite</em>, that there isn’t even a hint of mockery in his tone. It’s in there somewhere; Wei Ying just knows it..</p><p>He turns serious, the smile fading from his mouth.</p><p>“I know about you and Jiang Cheng,” he says. Lan Xichen’s face stills and goes a little pale.</p><p>“There’s nothing between Sect Leader Jiang and I.” He seems sincere enough, but the colour has drained from his cheeks and lips, and he’s not looking directly at Wei Ying.</p><p>He scoffs. “I know you don’t actually call him that to his face.”</p><p>They’re on a courtesy-name basis now, apparently. No surnames required. From there, it’s only a short jump to birth names, which is when, Wei Ying reckons, it will really start getting serious.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s own face is currently undergoing a rather interesting change, in that his previous pallour is being rapidly suffused by a vibrant pink blush.</p><p>“There really isn’t anything between us,” he insists.</p><p>Despite the denial, Wei Ying doesn’t give up. That’s not his style; he just keeps poking and prodding until he gets his answers. Jiang Cheng can attest to that.</p><p>“But you’d like there to be, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>Lan Xichen doesn’t quite choke on air, but it’s a near thing. Wei Ying watches as he struggles and finally regains control of himself. And then tries – and fails – to regain his usual tranquil expression. His eyes are still too wide for that to work.</p><p>“I– I’m not sure what gave you that idea,” he stammers.</p><p>This time, Wei Ying really does roll his eyes.</p><p>“Please, I’m not stupid. Or blind, either. I can see how you look at him.” Like his little brother is something precious, something to be sheltered from the rain and held up to the sun. It’s sweet. It’s so sweet it’s kind of gross, actually.</p><p>But it’s no less than Jiang Cheng deserves. Wei Ying knows better than anyone how difficult his life has been, how rarely he’s ever had anyone to look at him like that. He wants Jiang Cheng to be happy; he really does.</p><p>It doesn’t mean he isn’t going to give Lan Xichen hell, though. Or that he won’t make clear, in no uncertain terms, that if he screws up, Wei Ying will have his head on a pike.</p><p>Ah, revenge is fucking delicious.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s shoulders slump. He seems almost defeated. “Is it really that obvious?”</p><p>All right. Wei Ying isn’t <em>entirely</em> heartless, and Lan Xichen looks altogether too much like a kicked bunny for his own good. Gods damn it, he can’t even be a proper asshole to his future two-way brother-in-law. He’s a failure, Wei Ying thinks despairingly. He didn’t even last five minutes.</p><p>Out loud, he replies, “yes. Yes, it is. Everyone could see it, even the kids.”</p><p><em>Everyone except Jiang Cheng</em>.</p><p>Sometimes, Wei Ying thinks that if he didn’t know better, he’d question his brother’s intelligence. Lan Xichen literally came out of his year-long seclusion to be there while Jiang Cheng apologised to his nephew. The Lan sect leader’s feelings are so glaringly obvious it’s impossible to miss them. How can anyone be that oblivious?</p><p><em>You were</em>, his subconscious reminds him.</p><p>
  <em>Shut up.</em>
</p><p>“For what it’s worth,” Wei Ying offers, speaking up again, “he was looking at you, too.”</p><p>Lan Xichen’s eyes widen even further. They’re darker than Lan Zhan’s, Wei Ying notices, but not by all that much. Just enough to distinguish between them, for someone who doesn’t know the two brothers all that well.</p><p>It’s different for Wei Ying, who knows every edge and plane of his husband’s body, his slow, precise wit, the curve of his soft, secret smile. Lan Zhan and his brother are like dawn and sunset – the same clouds and colours, yet completely distinct from each other.</p><p>Wei Ying is well aware that if this is supposed to be an interrogation, he’s doing a terrible job of it. But whatever, right? He’s always been better at winging things anyway.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure he feels the same way about you as you do about him,” he continues. In fact, he’s almost sure of it. He has a sneaking suspicion that Lan Xichen was the one to convince Jiang Cheng to show up at the <em>jingshi</em> this morning. And that Jiang Cheng had probably spent the night with him, if the ungodly hour they arrived at was any indication.</p><p>But all that aside, since the two of them have begun…talking, or whatever it is they do in Lan Xichen’s little cottage, Wei Ying can’t deny that his little brother has mellowed a lot. Something about the older sect leader has smoothed his sharp edges a little, made him slower to anger and quicker to smile. It’s a good change.</p><p>Lan Xichen sighs. “I’d like to think so, but I’m not certain. He seems– he seems to be interested only in friendship.”</p><p>The younger man nearly spits blood. He did <em>not</em> sign up for this. Wei Ying has many skills, including <em>dizi</em>-playing, corpse-raising and a legendary spice tolerance, but he is <em>not</em> qualified for relationship counselling, thank you very much.</p><p>He schools his face into a long-suffering expression. The things he does for his family.</p><p>“Look,” he says. “Jiang Cheng likes you, all right? I know; I’m his brother. But it’s more likely than not that <em>he</em> doesn’t know. And even if he did, he wouldn’t say anything.”</p><p>The look on the other man’s face is one of slowly-growing hope, mixed with a tinge of dismay at the second half of Wei Ying’s little speech. Wei Ying fixes him with his most penetrating stare.</p><p>“If you wait for him to make the first move, you’re going to be waiting until one or both of you ascend to immortality. Jiang Cheng doesn’t like to acknowledge that he has feelings–” here, Lan Xichen stifles a chuckle despite himself – “so if you want this…thing, or whatever, to go anywhere, you have to start it.”</p><p>“And it’ll be tough, and it might take a long time; so you better think really fucking hard about what you want before you do anything. Once you decide, you can’t change your mind. No take-backs. You have to try your hardest to make it work; if it doesn’t, it better not be because you didn’t try.”</p><p>“Because if you give up on my brother, I’ll kill you.”</p><p>And Wei Ying means every word of it. He sets his jaw and looks Lan Xichen in the eyes, and tries to convey how very, very serious he’s being. Sure, he may not be the Yiling Patriarch anymore, and Lan Xichen may be the leader of the sect Wei Ying now calls home, but he can and will follow through on that threat.</p><p>Slowly, the other man blinks. “I understand,” he says, just as slowly.</p><p>“You have my word. I will not give up on him.”</p><p>Lan Xichen doesn’t seem afraid. Gone is the nervousness, the paleness and the shaky blush. He suddenly seems steady, as sure of himself as Wei Ying has seen him since he sat down. He’s serious too.</p><p>That eases the knot in Wei Ying’s chest a little.</p><p>“Good,” he says, and gives a bow that signals that Lan Xichen is free to go. Not that he was ever trapped here in the first place, but it’s the principle of the matter.</p><p>The other man stands up, and turns towards the door. The same way he came in, just a little over an hour before. Watching him go, Wei Ying suddenly realises he has one more thing to say.</p><p>“I trust you, Lan Xichen,” he calls out, stopping said man in his tracks. “Don’t fuck this up.”</p><p>Lan Xichen smiles back at him. “I won’t.”</p><p>And then he leaves.</p>

    <p>Lan Huan finds Jiang Wanyin on the way back to his cottage, in a rather out-of-the-way little garden. He’s just sitting there, staring off into space, but he’s not fidgeting with Zidian, so Lan Huan takes that as a good sign.</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s words from when they were in the <em>jingshi</em> keep coming back to him.</p><p>
  <em>I trust you, Lan Xichen. Don’t fuck this up.</em>
</p><p>Before, Lan Huan hadn’t been quite sure whether to be intimidated or laugh himself silly. (He’d mostly been leaning towards the latter.) On one hand, Wei Wuxian was, once upon a time, the Yiling Patriarch, creator of the Stygian Tiger Seal and thousands of other tools of demonic cultivation, and truly formidable in the field. On the other…</p><p>On the other, when he’s not being possessed by half the spirits in Luanzang-Gang, Wei Wuxian is very, very bad at scare tactics. He grins too much, too genuinely for them to be at all effective. Which, Lan Huan supposes, is not a bad thing.</p><p>Yet when Wei Wuxian sobered up, when the cheeky grin melted off his face and his voice lowered in the tone that said <em>listen here, if you hurt him, I will end you</em>, Lan Huan felt a chill run down his spine all the same. He was serious, and Lan Huan was simultaneously – yes, intimidated – and glad. The former for himself; but the latter for Jiang Wanyin, who despite everything, has managed to slowly begin repairing his relationship with his brother.</p><p>(Ah-Yao’s voice floats into his mind for a heartbeat, and Lan Huan has to concentrate very hard on thinking of Wangji, and Wangji only. His brother, yes – the one he helped raise. The ties between them the blood that flows through their veins, the centuries of shared family history, rather than words and once-heartfelt promises.)</p><p>Lan Huan pushes away the thoughts and plasters a smile on his face. Once it’s stuck, it stays firmly in place, and he feels it grow a little more real. He stands over Jiang Wanyin, who is seated on one of the stone benches lining the garden walls, and watches the midday sunlight shine off the ink of his hair.</p><p>The younger man jolts out of his reverie, head snapping up to look at Lan Huan.</p><p>“What did he want?”, Jiang Wanyin asks, in that way of his that always seems like it should be mildly offensive. Lan Huan isn’t offended though; he’s used to it, after speaking to him during conferences for years. He now finds it rather endearing actually, Jiang Wanyin’s directness. How he says exactly what he’s thinking.</p><p>Lan Huan’s ears go pink. “Just to talk about something.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Jiang Wanyin notices. He raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“Must have been some talk, then. Looks like he did quite a number on you.” Shakes his head. “I apologise if he said anything…inappropriate. My brother’s shamelessness knows no bounds.”</p><p><em>Look, Jiang Cheng likes you, alright?</em> Wei Wuxian’s voice rings in his hesad again, and the tips of Lan Huan’s ears redden further, even as leftover joy skips in his chest.</p><p>“It was nothing,” he insists. “Very informative, that was all.”</p><p>“Oh? What was it about?”</p><p>“Nothing,” he says again, despairing at how very defensive he sounds, even to his own ears. Jiang Wanyin’s eyebrow climbs higher, somehow managing to look imposing despite the angle at which his head is tilted up to look Lan Huan in the eyes.</p><p>“Now I have to know, if it got a reaction like <em>that</em>. What happened to calm, unflappable Sect Leader Lan?”</p><p>His eyes are alight with curiosity. For a moment, it’s obvious how he and Wei Wuxian are brothers. Lan Huan had never seen that before. But he also knows from his dealings with his brother-in-law, that once Wei Wuxian has that look on his face, nothing will deter him from getting the answers he seeks. Lan Huan suspects that Jiang Wanyin is the same way.</p><p>His stomach tenses, and he sends up a prayer to the gods to be merciful. <em>Please don’t let him laugh. I don’t think I could take it if he laughed.</em></p><p>Lan Huan smoothes his face into as placid an expression as he can. Yet try as he might, he can’t rub away the last lingering tinge of embarrassment.</p><p>“Your brother…”, here, he pauses, trying to choose his words carefully to be as un-alarming as possible. Then gives it up as a bad job and spits it all out at once. “He seems to be under the impression that the two of us are together. Or at least, that we’d like to be.”</p><p><em>Please don’t let him laugh</em>, Lan Huan pleads again silently. As he watches, Jiang Wanyin’s face contorts into an unreadable expression. Lan Huan’s prayer changes.</p><p><em>Please let that not be disgust</em>, he thinks even more fervently than before. That would be even worse. Lan Huan might actually cry.</p><p>Instead, the younger man sighs. Not laughter – not disgust either – which is good, Lan Huan supposes. But what is that supposed to mean?</p><p>“I thought I’d cured him of that already,” says Jiang Wanyin. His tone is flat. “I suppose I was mistaken.”</p><p><em>What is that supposed to mean?</em> It’s not disappointment, is it? No – that would be too strong a reaction. Even if Lan Huan had heard it in Jiang Wanyin’s voice, it would just be a product of his own ridiculous imagination. Wouldn’t it?</p><p>It’s not outright rejection though, and so a silly little part of him is still buoyed by a floaty feeling like hope. Wei Wuxian’s voice comes to echo in Lan Huan’s head again.</p><p>
  <em>Even if he knew, he wouldn’t say anything. You have to start it.</em>
</p><p>Should he?</p><p>He should. He wants to, even. Wants so badly to say those words to him, the ones Lan Huan had spoken out loud this morning when Jiang Wanyin couldn’t hear him. When it was safe, and Lan Huan could tell the truth. It would be a weight off his chest, a relief. And if Wei Wuxian is right – of course he’s right, Lan Huan thinks (hopes) desperately, he’s his brother – then it would mean even more than that.</p><p>It would mean everything Lan Huan has never dared to hope for.</p><p>But what would he even say?</p><p><em>Do you want to be mistaken?</em> No – that’s too awkward. It’s nothing Lan Huan would say.</p><p><em>He wasn’t wrong?</em> It just doesn’t sound right.</p><p><em>I would want to be with you, if you’d have me?</em> Too much like something out of a romance novel. Or the confession of a pimply teenager to his sweetheart. Who reads too many romance novels.</p><p>
  <em>I love you?</em>
</p><p>He can’t say that.</p><p>Lan Huan resists the urge to slap his palm over his forehead and cover his eyes. It’s nothing wrong with any of those sentences. He’s just a coward.</p><p>In the end, he says nothing. The words he hasn’t quite thought of yet stay unformed on the tip of his tongue; he doesn’t let them out into the air. Lan Huan hates himself a little for it.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin shrugs, oblivious to Lan Huan’s inner turmoil. Even more oblivious to the fact that he’s the cause of most – if not all – of it. “I’m sorry if he was bothering you – he can get like that sometimes. You just have to ignore him.”</p><p>He gives a slight smile, and Lan Huan’s heart softens a bit. As consolation prizes go, that’s a lovely one. It even makes him feel less ashamed of his own spinelessness.</p><p>“It was interesting,” he says at last, vowing to himself that he will say something. Next time, though he’s not sure when that will be. Soon, at least. He just needs time to gather his courage, scattered as it is.</p><p>Then, belatedly, Lan Huan realises there is something else he’s forgotten to ask.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” He asks as politely as he can, gesturing around at the garden. Jiang Wanyin tips his head back fully, lets the sun spill across his face, bathing his sharp features in gold. Then he stands up, so he’s nearly of a height with Lan Huan.</p><p>“Waiting for you,” the other man says. Just as Lan Huan is reeling from this new information, he reaches into his sleeve and pulls out a folded piece of paper. It’s a missive, the nine-petaled lotus of Yumeng stamped into the broken wax seal. “There have been a few <em>xiongshi</em> sightings in Ranwan Village recently. More than usual. Since I’m in the vicinity, my sect sent a message to ask if I could deal with them. For convenience sake.”</p><p>Ranwan Village is one of the tiny villages near the border between Yunmeng and Gusu – on the Yunmeng side, of course. It’s rather remote, surrounded by forest, and far away from Lotus Pier. It is, however, decidedly nearer to Cloud Recesses, so it’s understandable that the Jiang sect would ask one of their own known to be closer by to handle the threat.</p><p>Yet requesting the sect leader himself to deal with the problem, like any other common disciple? It’s not unheard-of, but it’s rare for a sect leader to involve himself in such matters. It seems as though Jiang Wanyin takes the same approach to leading his clan as he does to most other things: hands-on, with maximum effort put in.</p><p>It’s very admirable.</p><p>What does it have to do with Lan Huan, though?</p><p>As if answering Lan Huan’s unspoken question, Jiang Wanyin looks away for a second. Like he’s experiencing a sudden bout of shyness. Then, he says, “I’m going tonight. Would you like to go with me?”</p><p>Lan Huan is speechless. Jiang Wanyin is inviting him on a night-hunt? Him, Lan Huan. It doesn’t sound quite real.</p><p>The other man seems to take his silence for reluctance. His eyes dart everywhere but Lan Huan’s face.</p><p>“It’s all right if you don’t want to. It’s just that, well, there <em>are</em> rather a lot of corpses and I’d like to have someone there as backup. And you haven’t been on a night-hunt in a while, so I thought you might like to go kill some <em>xiongshi</em>, or something. But you don’t have to go if you don’t want to.”</p><p>Oh. He’s nervous, Lan Huan realises. And awkward and uncharacteristically fidgety. A tiny seed of hope sprouts in his chest. Is it possible that…Jiang Wanyin might actually feel the same as Lan Huan does for him?</p><p>He feels his face break into a grin. It’s true; Lan Huan hasn’t been on a night-hunt in over a year. Sure, he’s cultivated in seclusion, practiced his swordwork and his forms, but he hasn’t flown on Shuoyue in months. And all of a sudden, he misses it fiercely – the wind in his hair and the world spread out below him, people and houses tiny as ants. The thrill of battle, too – the bone-deep satisfaction that yes, this is what he’s trained for, this is what he’s cultivated for. To do good in the world. To rid the world of evil.</p><p>He hasn’t done that in a very long time.</p><p>When Jiang Wanyin’s gaze finds him again, drifting reluctantly to his face, his eyes, his mouth, the younger man’s neck is flushed. Lan Huan’s smile widens.</p><p>“I would love to,” he says honestly. “Thank you for the offer. It would be an honour to go night-hunting with you.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin ducks his head once more, the blush on his neck even more pronounced than before and creeping upwards still. It’s almost reached his jaw.</p><p>“Don’t thank me, you idiot,” he replies, voice gruff. “It’s my back you’ll be watching.”</p><p>“Still, it’s only polite to show some form of gratitude for the invitation–”</p><p>“Just don’t get yourself killed, then. Or me. That’ll be thanks enough.”</p><p>He turns around and walks back the way he came. Probably on the way to his own rooms, or somewhere like that. Lan Huan watches him go, but his heart is light.</p>

    <p>When Jiang Cheng arrives at the gates of Cloud Recesses, Lan Xichen is waiting for him just outside, a dark silhouette backlit in gold by the last rays of the setting sun. Jiang Cheng wanders closer, a hand on Sandu out of habit, only for it to fall away when Lan Xichen notices and smiles at him.</p><p>“I hope I haven’t kept you waiting long,” Jiang Cheng says as they take the first steps out past the gates. They’ll be walking for just a bit – halfway down the mountain – before they get on their swords and fly the rest of the way to Ranwan Village.</p><p>“Not at all,” the older man replies easily, falling into step beside him. His legs are slightly longer, but not by much, so it’s natural to walk with him. “I merely favour being early to the alternative.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng snorts. “I wish my nephew had the same attitude.”</p><p>That gets a chuckle from his companion, and Jiang Cheng, encouraged, finally gathers the nerve to smile back at him. Then he notices that for the first time since Lan Xichen went into seclusion, he has his xiao, Liebing, tied to his waist next to Shuoyue. An inexplicable warmth spreads through his chest.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s not sure how he knows this, but he knows that this is an insight into Lan Xichen’s state of mind. And it has definitely improved, even if just by a little.</p><p>They reach the halfway point and mount their swords. Jiang Cheng watches Lan Xichen out of the corner of his eye. This may be a familiar ritual for him, but the Lan sect leader hasn’t flown in over a year, and it’s better to be concerned than not.</p><p>Yet Shuoyue doesn’t so much as wobble when Lan Xichen steps on, and he takes flight as easily and gracefully as if he’s been doing this every day since the last time he did. Jiang Cheng follows on his own Sandu, and they ascend together, the dirt of the mountain path beneath them giving way to the tops of trees, and then, minutes later, the sprawling chaos of Caiyi village, lanterns and candles lighting up for the night.</p><p>Lan Xichen lets out a joyous laugh. His excitement is infectious, and Jiang Cheng is tempted to laugh with him.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lan Xichen drops like a stone. He goes into a nosedive, his arms stretched out like he’s a bird, before pulling back abruptly and swooping up again. Chasing the moon just edging up over the horizon.</p><p>“I’d forgotten how much fun this was,” he says breathlessly, coming alongside Jiang Cheng, who scowls to hide the way his heart is fluttering in his chest. For absolutely no reason, the stupid fucker – not even the way Lan Xichen’s eyes are shining, brighter than the stars, or the split second of bone-crushing relief when he’d fallen out of sight only to come back again a moment later.</p><p>But Jiang Cheng can’t stay mad for long. Not when Lan Xichen is doing flips and grinning like a child first learning how to fly, stretching his wings after so long grounded.</p><p>“You need to get out more,” he grumbles back half-heartedly, and leaves it at that.</p><p>Lan Xichen settles down a bit after that, though he loses none of his excitement for it – a good thing; Jiang Cheng would kick himself if he made that happen – and they fly in silence the rest of the way. It’s not uncomfortable, the quiet. It’s not that they have nothing to talk about, but rather that they don’t feel the need to say it. There’s no need to fill the silence with words to chase away the awkwardness. No need to plug the gap between them with conversation, because they already fit together just fine.</p><p>Something heavy in Jiang Cheng’s heart lifts.</p><p>If he wasn’t already in the air, he’d say it feels like flying.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>They arrive at Ranwan Village when the moon is nearly halfway up the sky. A short trip; barely an hour, or perhaps less. The roofs of the houses, just slightly lighter than the black-washed treetops of the forest they’ve been flying over for the past fifteen minutes, appear without warning.</p><p>Jiang Cheng calls for Lan Xichen to land, and they descend towards the dim, scattered lights shining through the windows onto the streets below. They dismount, and Jiang Cheng sheathes Sandu. His companion does the same.</p><p>The street they land in is hard-packed dirt, worn smooth from decades of hooves and feet alike tramping over it day after day. A row of shops line it on either side, small and nondescript, some open and still hawking wares, others shuttered for the night. There are few people outside, given the hour – most of the homes’ lights are on – but those that are are going about their own business, talking and laughing as if there wasn’t an immediate threat to their safety. In the form of a truly appalling number of fierce corpses just a few miles away, according to the report.</p><p>They’re not frightened, Jiang Cheng thinks with something approaching satisfaction. They’re from Yunmeng, after all. Even though he’s never been to this particular town before, it’s obvious. His are a proud people, and every single one of these holds their head high. Unafraid.</p><p>Jiang Cheng turns to Lan Xichen. “We’re going to have to ask for directions,” he says. “The report wasn’t exactly precise when it mentioned where most of the <em>xiongshi</em> were found.”</p><p>“Alright,” the other man agrees.</p><p>But as they approach one of the shops still open at this time of night, Lan Xichen seems to withdraw into himself. It’s barely noticeable, but Jiang Cheng can tell when his smile starts to look a little forced.</p><p><em>That’s right</em>, he realises. This is Lan Xichen’s first trip outside Cloud Recesses since Guanyin Temple. Before, when they left his cottage for the cold springs, he’d been nervous, going out of his way to take the less-frequented paths out of a desire not to be seen. And that was back in his home sect, with people he knew. People he’d grown up with.</p><p>How much worse must it be now, to be in an unfamiliar sect, surrounded by strangers? Jiang Cheng kicks himself for not thinking of it before.</p><p>Barely a few feet from the stall, Jiang Cheng stops and turns to his companion, who’s looking slightly white-faced, even under the silvery light of the moon. His shoulders are stiff as wooden planks.</p><p>“You can stay here if you want. I’ll go talk to him.” Jiang Cheng jerks his head towards the man running the fruit stall, hawking what’s left of his produce for the day. He’s far past middle age and skinny as a rail, his hair almost completely silver and face wrinkled like a dried apple. Completely non-threatening.</p><p>Lan Xichen stays silent for a moment, then sets his jaw. He seems to come to a decision.</p><p>“No, I’ll go with you,” he says finally. Then cracks a smile. “I’m not completely useless.”</p><p>His tone is light, but the tension in his frame gives him away. As does the strange, brittle-sounding edge to his voice.</p><p><em>Oh.</em> Jiang Cheng’s offended him.</p><p>Really – he hadn’t meant to; he’s only now realising what his words sound like. As if he’s babying Lan Xichen, a man four years his senior and a war veteran just the same as him. Insinuating that he’s too fragile to talk to a fucking fruit-seller, of all people.</p><p>He really could kick himself.</p><p>Even if Lan Xichen wasn’t angry about it, that had to rankle. Or at least sting a bit. To be thought that weak…Jiang Cheng knows he’d punch out the teeth of anyone who ever <em>dared</em> to even imply such a thing about him.</p><p>“I apologise,” he says, hardening his voice to show that yes, he does take Lan Xichen seriously.</p><p>“I hadn’t meant to come across that way. Of course you’re not. I simply meant that–” here, he flounders, backtracks – “I didn’t want you to be uncomfortable, is all. I invited you out here; it’s my responsibility to make sure you have a good time. Not to make you do things you don’t want.”</p><p>He stops, suddenly acutely aware of how sentimental he sounds. Jiang Cheng doesn’t <em>do</em> sentimental. He might actually be allergic to it. But Lan Xichen’s eyes soften, so he takes that as a sign that he’s doing something right at least.</p><p>“It’s all right. I shouldn’t have been so sensitive, either.”</p><p>That said, Lan Xichen sets off towards the fruit stall, back straight with what looks like determination. Jiang Cheng nearly grabs his arm to drag him back, demand to know if that’s what he <em>really</em> wants, or if it’s just something he’s doing because he thinks he has to, but then he stops. Lan Xichen is a grown-ass man. He can make his own decisions. And anyway, this is a step in the right direction; who is Jiang Cheng to keep him from it?</p><p>He’s being ridiculous. So fucking ridiculous.</p><p>Jiang Cheng spares a moment to shake his head at himself, and then follows suit.</p><p>When he catches up with Lan Xichen, the other sect leader is leaning over the counter, talking to the old fruit-seller. He greets Lan Xichen with a gruff ‘what do you want’ and a wary look that lightens slightly at the warm smile on the younger man’s face.</p><p>“Sorry to bother you, sir, but could we have a moment of your time?”</p><p>Lan Xichen sounds perfectly courteous, genuinely apologetic, as though he’s just interrupted a meeting of the Council of Elders instead of talking to an old shop-keeper. Most cultivators wouldn’t treat an ordinary person with such respect; hell, Jiang Cheng wouldn’t either – though that’s mostly because he doesn’t treat anyone very respectfully.</p><p>The fruit-seller’s expression softens further.</p><p>“Sir, eh?”, he says, voice croaky with age. “Never heard that one before. You the ones they sent to get rid of the corpses?”</p><p>Both of them nod.</p><p>“We are. But we were not told of their exact location, and would very much appreciate it if you could point us in the right direction.”</p><p>The shopkeeper picks up an orange from a basket beside the counter and rubs it absently on his sleeve. Lan Xichen watches his movements carefully.</p><p>“Well, I haven’t seen ‘em myself, but I heard they’re north a-ways, maybe a mile into the forest. Nasty creatures, and there’s lots of them, too. You hear ‘em sometimes at night, on the far side of town.”</p><p>“If you don’t mind us asking, where did they all come from?” At the old man’s suspicious look, Lan Xichen spreads his hands in front of him in a placating gensture. “Something must have happened, for there to be so many. Sometimes knowing the cause of death of a corpse can aid in its defeat.”</p><p>“There was a storm a month back. A bad one. Washed away whole families; we couldn’t bury ‘em all because we couldn’t find ‘em. Guess they ended up in the forest.”</p><p>The two cultivators exchange a look. From the sound of it, this could get ugly. Drowning is not a pleasant way to die, and corpses made that way have a tendency to come back mean. No more intelligent than the average <em>xiongshi</em>, of course, but they’re vicious and a pain in the ass.</p><p>Jiang Cheng steps forward. “Thank you for your time,” he says, as courteously as he can.</p><p>The old man snorts, and picks up another orange. “Just get rid of the damn things.”</p><p>“We’ll do our best,” promises Lan Xichen with a smile. As they turn to go, Jiang Cheng notices his gaze lingering on the bright oranges, before he walks away with a sigh. Jiang Cheng makes a mental note to buy him a few when they get back – he looks like he’d appreciate them.</p><p>They start on the road away from town, following the path north, towards the forest.</p>

    <p>The old man was right: they hear the corpses before they see them.</p><p>At first, as they make their way northward as per the fruit-seller’s highly unspecific directions, the only sounds are their footsteps and the noises of the forest animals. Then the shrieking starts.</p><p>It’s not really shrieking – after all, that requires movement of the vocal cords, which is rather impossible for <em>xiongshi</em>, seeing as theirs are stiff with death. Rather, it’s a sort of guttural groaning, like choking. Or drowning on dry land.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s head whips round to look at Lan Xichen, who is already looking back at him. He’s heard it too. Excitement bubbles up behind Jiang Cheng’s teeth; how long has it been since he last night-hunted with a partner? One at least within ten years of his own age? (Jin Ling doesn’t count.)</p><p>Too fucking long, that’s what.</p><p>They draw their swords and advance as silently as possible, careful not to step on any fallen branches or alert the corpses to their presence. That would be a rookie mistake to make.</p><p>The choking sounds intensify, growing louder the further in they walk. Jiang Cheng’s heart begins to beat faster in his chest. His pulse thrums with the anticipation of a fight, the way it always does. Beside him, Lan Xichen is wearing a peculiar expression: a small smile, not even wide enough to see his teeth. He doesn’t seem to notice it, so utterly absorbed is he in the prospect of the hunt before him.</p><p>Finally, the path opens up, and the leaves and branches ahead of them give way to a small clearing. A clearing filled with corpses.</p><p>The second thing Jiang Cheng notices is the stench. Rotting flesh, foul and familiar. It forces its way down his throat and coats his tongue, but he doesn’t gag. Doesn’t even make a face.</p><p>The <em>xiongshi</em> are everywhere, shuffling around blindly, clawing at the bark of trees they bump into. All making that awful groaning, spluttering noise, still trying to clear the stormwater out of their decaying lungs.</p><p>Their faces blur together in the moonlight, white misshapen ovals. One of them has a chunk of driftwood sticking out of its bloated forehead. Its face is smeared with blood.</p><p>Suddenly, it’s as if a switch has flipped. The corpses, wandering aimlessly, turn as one towards the two humans in their midst. The <em>xiongshi</em> closest to them stills. Its face contorts into a snarl, and it leaps at them.</p><p>Jiang Cheng strikes at it with Sandu, cleaving its head from its body in one fluid motion. The head hits the forest floor with a ‘thud’, and rolls to some six feet away. Glassy dead-fish eyes staring up at the sky.</p><p>Then all hell breaks loose. The other corpses, following the first’s lead, surge towards them, arms outstretched and hands crooked into claws, mouths yawning open to bite. Jiang Cheng sends a bolt of spiritual energy into his hand, and Zidian shifts into a whip. It crackles with purple lightning, illuminating the entire clearing.</p><p>Behind him, Lan Xichen shifts into position, his own sword at the ready. They stand back-to-back, ready to face the oncoming horde.</p><p>And for the next…gods-know-how-long, they do. Jiang Cheng’s world narrows to the slavering corpses, and time seems to simultaneously stretch out and pull in on itself. The <em>xiongshi</em> are simply targets for his blade, nothing more, and he forgets where he is.</p><p>He hacks and slashes, sends Zidian darting out to electrocute three or so <em>xiongshi</em> at a time, and forgets that he’s in a forest in the ass end of nowhere, miles from the tiniest fucking town he’s seen in years. He forgets that he’s a sect leader, that he’s an orphan and a brother and a sort of pseudo-father figure, that this is his hundred-and-seventh battle or some other number that’s both too high and not high enough.</p><p>Between one enemy and the next, between the thrusts of his sword and the arcs of severed limbs flying through the air, Jiang Cheng just <em>is</em>.</p><p>The corpses have them surrounded, and there are so fucking many of them. For every one that Jiang Cheng cuts down, another takes its place. But eventually, after what feels like hours and minutes and seconds of fighting, Jiang Cheng fells a corpse and doesn’t find another one coming forward to meet him.</p><p>It’s a shock; that’s what pulls him out of the battle-trance he’s fallen into without realising it. He surfaces from the depths of his own mind and looks around.</p><p>The ground is littered with the twice-slain bodies of the <em>xiongshi</em>. He and Lan Xichen are standing in the only patch of clear ground – and even that is spattered with black blood – ringed by corpses, still and unmoving. Not even a twitch.</p><p>Jiang Cheng wipes Sandu on his sleeve, sheathes it and turns to his companion, who skewers the last <em>xiongshi</em> on the end of Shuoyue. It falls to the dirt with a dull sound, and doesn’t get up again.</p><p>Lan Xichen swivels to face him as well, meeting his eyes with a smile. His eyes are alight with the thrill of battle, of felling an enemy that had them vastly outnumbered. And yet, despite the carnage that surrounds them, he <em>glows</em> under the moonlight. Maybe it’s the white of his robes, which have somehow miraculously emerged from that ordeal completely unscathed.</p><p>Fucking Lan sorcery.</p><p>Jiang Cheng glances down at his own robes, which are rightfully filthy, thank you very much, spattered with blood and gore as they should be. His companion seems to notice, throws back his head, and lets out a laugh.</p><p>Lan Xichen is a man, so his laughter doesn’t sound like the chiming of bells or whatever nonsense, but somehow it’s the nicest sound Jiang Cheng has ever heard.</p><p>No – it’s just the adrenaline talking. Has to be.</p><p>“That was <em>amazing</em>,” Lan Xichen says. Jiang Cheng can’t quite figure out how he can still be smiling while his mouth is moving. He looks so happy. “It’s been so long–”</p><p>But then his words cut off. His face freezes; his eyes widen. They’re not on Jiang Cheng anymore, but somewhere over his shoulder. Past it.</p><p>Behind him, something makes a sound. A deep groan, sputtering and menacing.</p><p>A flash of understanding overtakes Jiang Cheng. He whirls around, only to see a <em>xiongshi</em> – one they’d mistaken for dead – burst out from under the body of a fallen comrade and lunge at him.</p><p>It’s too close. He doesn’t have time to react before sharp nails rake across his chest, shearing through the cloth of his robes, tearing into flesh. Fire erupts along his skin. It’s like being flayed open all over again.</p><p>Jiang Cheng reaches for his sword, only to remember he’s sheathed it. Zidian sits uselessly on his finger, now in ring form. The <em>xiongshi</em>’s bloated, decaying hands reach for his throat. It’ll rip him apart, he knows. A fitting end. Killed by an ordinary corpse. That, and his own carelessness.</p><p>His last thought is that he won’t close his eyes. He won’t.</p><p>Or it should be his last thought. But it isn’t.</p><p>There is the glint of silver. The sound of metal sinking into flesh. Sinking, and hitting bone. And then shearing right through it.</p><p>Just a flash, and it’s gone again. The corpse’s arms – those arms outstretched, barely an inch from the soft skin of Jiang Cheng’s throat – fall to the ground.</p><p>The corpse gurgles; there’s another flicker of silver, and then a black line opens up in its throat. Its head tips backwards, exposing a stump, and both body and head collapse, sprawling in a heap on top of its own severed arms.</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks up, and there’s Lan Xichen, pulling Shuoyue out of the body of the fallen <em>xiongshi</em>. Its blood runs off the sword and drips to the ground.</p><p><em>Holy fucking shit</em>. He’s alive.</p><p>Lan Xichen just saved his life.</p><p>The searing pain in his chest intensifies. In the shock of nearly dying – and getting his ass saved by another sect leader –Jiang Cheng forgets to muffle the gasp that escapes. Abruptly, a pair of worried gold eyes are on him, and Lan Xichen’s clean, non-blood-spattered face fills his vision.</p><p>“Oh gods, Wanyin, are you all right?”</p><p>Somewhere in the depths of Jiang Cheng’s shell-shocked mind, he finds the words to say, “I’m fine.”</p><p>And he will be, soon enough. He stills his – suddenly shaking – hands and presses the right meridians, stopping the blood flow from the wound in his chest. He’ll fix it when he gets back. He’ll be fine.</p><p>He doesn’t know why this is affecting him so much. Jiang Cheng has been in plenty of life-or-death situations before. He’s been almost-killed too many times to count. By right, this shouldn’t even faze him.</p><p>It shouldn’t even have happened at all, actually. He was stupid; he should have checked all the corpses. Made sure they really were dead, rather than assuming it. Rule number one of the battlefield: never assume anything of your enemy.</p><p>He’s such a fucking <em>idiot</em>.</p><p>And now Lan Xichen has dropped his sword in the dirt and rushed towards him. Strong arms wrap around his back and Jiang Cheng finds himself crushed to Lan Xichen’s chest, the older man’s voice in his ear.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he whispers. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Over and over again. Jiang Cheng is cast back to that afternoon by the cold springs, Zidian crackling in his hand and his stomach aching from retching, saying those same words like a prayer. But that was completely different. Lan Xichen has nothing to be sorry for.</p><p>This was Jiang Cheng’s mistake. Jiang Cheng’s screw-up. He has no right to an apology, no right to the comfort being offered him. No right to be held like a child hiding from the dark, leaning into someone else as though their touch might chase away the demons.</p><p>And oddly enough, it’s at that moment that the world shifts. A puzzle piece Jiang Cheng didn’t even know he had, slotting into a puzzle he didn’t know he was solving.</p><p>All of a sudden, he knows what that aching feeling in his chest is – deep beneath the old scratches and the burning of the new wound that will eventually become just another scar. It aches, and it fills every corner of his body with its aching.</p><p><em>Longing</em>.</p><p>Jiang Cheng nearly throws back his head and laughs, despite his injury, despite the fact that he’s covered in blood that’s a mixture of the corpses’ and his own. Of course it is – he should have seen it before. After all, Lan Xichen is…well, Lan Xichen. Pure and kind, and brave when he doesn’t have to be. He’s good, the best person Jiang Cheng knows and it makes so much sense, because Jiang Cheng sees good things and he wants them. That’s how it is.</p><p>He’s been longing his entire life. For his parents’ affection, for his sister’s, for his brother’s; it makes sense that he wants this, too. But how often has he ever gotten what he wants? When was the last time that happened?</p><p>Eventually, Lan Xichen pulls back. He retrieves Shuoyue and wipes it on his robes.</p><p>“We should go back,” he says. “That wound needs looking at.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng just nods dully. Follows him as his companion mounts his sword and sets off into the night sky. The moon is high overhead, but Jiang Cheng doesn’t notice. Doesn’t notice, because all he can think about is the aching in his bones, and the dark splotch on Lan Xichen’s once-pristine white robes where his blood had soaked through the cloth.</p><p>Lan Xichen had been so clean. Then Jiang Cheng touched him and made him dirty. Tainted him, bathed him in blood. It won’t wash out – that much he knows from hearing the laundry women back at Lotus Pier complain at him when he comes back from night-hunts.</p><p>Jiang Cheng finally lets himself give voice to the thought in his head, shrieking and clamouring to be heard. He loves Lan Xichen. Not like a brother, or a friend, but in a way that he’s never felt for anyone before. He thinks he’s known for a while now, but never let himself discover it.</p><p>But he can’t ever act on it. Can’t ever say anything, because Lan Xichen won’t want him. He doesn’t deserve him, either. Lan Xichen is too good – much too good – for him.</p><p>He’s like a newly-made vase sitting in a shop window, clean and white and perfect. And Jiang Cheng can come by to look at him every day, can spend hours talking to him and wishing he could have him for real, but he never will. Because Jiang Cheng doesn’t have enough for him – and even if he could, he’d break him, just like he breaks everything. He knows it. He can’t ever touch him, not without leaving dirt and smudges all over him so he isn’t clean anymore.</p><p>Jiang Cheng loves Lan Xichen, he knows that now. But he also knows that he can’t do anything about it, or else he’ll ruin everything.</p>

          <p>Hey everyone! I am sorry for this chapter - I cannot, for the life of me, write a serious fight scene. But we have angst and Jiang Cheng figuring out his feelings, so I hope that makes up for it.</p><p>Some of y'all have pointed out the (rather obvious) 2Ha Easter egg in the two previous chapters. Yes, Ranwan Village is named after the ship-name for Moran and Chu Wanning, mostly because I'm lazy and uncreative. I wonder if you caught the other reference in the second-last paragraph of this chapter. Hint: it involved Moran and a lantern. </p><p>BUT ALSO - I just finished the novel last week (the fastest I've ever read any Chinese novel, 'cause it only took 2 weeks for 300+ chapters, be proud of me), and I'm so in love with it. It may have been a xianxia romance novel - and may have dealt with some really shady themes and characters - but it makes you think. About morality, right and wrong and who gets to decide which is which; also the ethics of revenge and why self-righteousness is so dangerous. It's thought-provoking without being preachy, and it's absolutely amazing. Moran kind of reminds me of Wei Wuxian, and Chu Wanning is an odd fusion of Lan Wangji and Lan Xichen. BTW: Chu Wanning is my favourite. But so many characters in the story deserved better: Gongyi Xiao, Ye Wangxi, even Shi Mei (the present-day one). Xue Meng reminds me so much of Jiang Cheng it hurts - he definitely deserved better. </p><p>All in all, though, it was a really great book - I've never read any other book, in English or Chinese, that made me think as much as 2Ha did. IF you haven't read it, you should definitely give it a go.</p><p>Okay, book promotion over. Today's song is 'Hero' by Family Of The Year.</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng isn’t quite sure how they got back to Cloud Recesses. He has a vague memory of flying, standing on Sandu and trying his hardest not to fall off when his chest wound started bleeding again and his knees went weak. He managed somehow, obviously, given that he’s still alive and not dead in a ditch somewhere, but it’s mostly a blur, and he’s grateful for it.</p><p>Given the late hour, the corridors are empty, which is another thing he’s grateful for. It means no one’s there to watch as he puts up a truly pathetic protest to be allowed to go back to his rooms to sleep off the night’s events, only to be promptly overruled by Lan Xichen and chivvied off to the man’s own cottage to “get his wound looked at”. Apparently, Lan Xichen is a fucking doctor.</p><p>It’s the first time Jiang Cheng regrets his decision to stay at Cloud Recesses. It’s not like he’s never treated his own wounds before, and he’s not dead yet. He misses home – Lotus Pier and his study and bedroom and multitude of places to hide in and sulk where no one would dare disturb him.</p><p>Instead, he is given no time at all to recover from his recent earth-shattering revelation, and is sent off, still reeling – exhausted and feeling way more fragile than he should ever be – for another couple of hours with the person said earth-shattering revelation was about. There’s no way this will end well.</p><p>But Jiang Cheng can’t say any of that, and so that’s how he finds himself here, half-undressed in Lan Xichen’s living room. The man himself has produced a medical kit from somewhere in his house. It’s the same one as last night; the one Lan Xichen used on Jiang Cheng’s hands after he’d so stupidly cut one of them on his own whip and smashed the other into a wall.</p><p>He keeps making Lan Xichen fix him up. He needs to stop doing that.</p><p>The older sect leader clicks his tongue.</p><p>“Stop squirming,” he says, giving Jiang Cheng a look that practically screams disapproval. Lan Xichen has a towel in his hand and is using it to clean away the dried blood that has crusted over Jiang Cheng’s wound; his other hand splayed across Jiang Cheng’s chest, fingers laid over his scars like he doesn’t even care that they’re there.</p><p>Jiang Cheng is torn between leaning into the touch and scrambling away. Far away, to his own rooms in the main building, or preferably all the way back to Lotus Pier. The latter seems to be winning out, hence Lan Xichen’s mild reprimand.</p><p>By now, the once-white towel is streaked with a mixture of rust-brown and bright red. Jiang Cheng can’t help the hiss he lets out as Lan Xichen presses it into the cut, rubbing the fabric against torn skin.</p><p>“If you stopped moving, it would hurt less,” Lan Xichen tells him.</p><p>“It doesn’t hurt,” Jiang Cheng insists, which both of them know is utter bullshit. But Jiang Cheng’s already lost enough face tonight, so thankfully, Lan Xichen doesn’t call him out on it.</p><p>Instead, he bends his head low and continues cleaning out the wound. His swipes with the cloth are gentler this time, and there’s an expression of complete focus on his face, like patching Jiang Cheng up is the most important thing he could be doing with his time.</p><p>From this angle, all Jiang Cheng can see of Lan Xichen’s face is the straight slope of his nose and the inky-black sweep of his lashes against his pale skin. A knot of…something ties itself in the pit of Jiang Cheng’s stomach. It feels foreign, both hollow and the fullest he’s ever been.</p><p>Suddenly, he notices that every muscle in his body is tense. His back ramrod-straight, breaths shallow and harsh. Jiang Cheng makes an effort to loosen up, to slow his breathing before it becomes obvious, but despite his best efforts, Lan Xichen notices.</p><p>Of course he does.</p><p>“Relax,” he says. The hand holding the cloth stills, and his other hand shifts to Jiang Cheng’s shoulder. “I know it hurts, but I’m almost done.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng wants to snap back at that. He’s not a <em>baby</em>; of course he can take a little pain. He’s been wounded much, much worse than this on the battlefield. But saying that would mean having to admit to the real reason he feels like he’s about to shake out of his own skin, so he keeps his mouth shut.</p><p>True to his word, Lan Xichen gives the gash in Jiang Cheng’s chest a last pass with the cloth and sets it down next to him. <em>Finally</em>. Jiang Cheng makes a move to stand to retrieve his robes, but Lan Xichen’s hand tightens on his shoulder.</p><p>“Sit down,” he says. “I’m not finished.”</p><p>His voice is gentle but stern, his mouth set in a determined line and Jiang Cheng’s mouth feels entirely too dry right now. He sits back down.</p><p>Lan Xichen makes an approving noise and reaches for the jar of ointment. He opens it, scoops up a little of the paste with his fingers, then carefully smears it onto Jiang Cheng’s wound. His touch is light, like the brush of a dragonfly’s wing. Jiang Cheng shivers.</p><p>“Are you cold?” The older man asks, the concern in his voice nearly a tangible thing.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng answers in his flattest voice, hoping that will be enough to get Lan Xichen to let it alone, but the other sect leader asks at least twice more before it seems that Jiang Cheng’s increasingly vehement denials get through to him. By that time, he’s done with the ointment and is wrapping a linen bandage around Jiang Cheng’s torso.</p><p>His movements are still so careful. So gentle and soft, like Jiang Cheng is something to be careful with. Someone that deserves it.</p><p>He swallows the lump in his throat. When Lan Xichen ties the bandage in place and pulls back, Jiang Cheng reaches for his robes. Pulls them on over his chest, only barely fumbling with the knots, hiding every trace of the wound and Lan Xichen’s care from view. Even with the extra layers, he doesn’t feel any less exposed.</p><p>Lan Xichen is still looking at him, those dark gold eyes trained on his face, not looking anywhere else. Why is he looking at him like that?</p><p>“Thank you,” Jiang Cheng says gruffly, glancing away because he’s a coward like that and he’d rather run than face the reminder of everything he can’t have. Give him a sword and someone to fuck up any day; it’s him who’s his own worst enemy.</p><p>“Just as long as you’re all right,” is the other man’s immediate reply. It comes so quickly out of Lan Xichen’s mouth and his eyes widen when he finishes, so it’s obvious he hadn’t meant to say that. Which means it’s what he really wanted to say. A flush crawls its way past the high collar of his robes, and the tips of his ears go pink.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s stomach lurches. He feels a faint throbbing in his chest that has little to do with the place he was slashed open only an hour ago.</p><p>“I mean– I–” Lan Xichen stutters, as if the words are dying in his mouth before he can even push them out into the air. “I–”</p><p>He sounds as though he’s choking. Or like he’s on the verge of saying something important and it’s choking him.</p><p>
  <em>What if–</em>
</p><p>No. Jiang Cheng stops that thought cold before it can carry him off. It’s too dangerous to think like that. To hope.</p><p>He goes to pat Lan Xichen on the back – because at this point, the gasping is starting to become concerning – but the other man reddens further and shifts out of reach.</p><p>“Never mind,” he says, ducking his head. This time, it’s his turn to avoid eye contact.</p><p>Jiang Cheng lowers his hand from where it’s been hovering awkwardly in the air. Curses himself for being an idiot.</p><p><em>He’s too good for you</em>, the voice in his head whispers to him. But he doesn’t argue with it. How can he? It’s right. Even this much – this…friendship, whatever it is they have – is more than Jiang Cheng deserves. More than he’s ever had before.</p><p>What would someone like Lan Xichen want with someone like him?</p><p><em>Because he’s lonely, probably</em>, the voice replies. <em>He hasn’t had anyone in a very long time, and you’re the closest thing right now.</em></p><p>He tells it to shut up, because every word is a dagger in his chest and he’s already been slashed up once today, thank you very much. He doesn’t need this shit from his own head.</p><p><em>It’s not real</em>, it continues to insist. <em>You need him more than he needs you</em>.</p><p>And isn’t that the fucking truth? Jiang Cheng always, <em>always</em> needs people, even when they don’t need him. And Lan Xichen…</p><p>These past two weeks, Jiang Cheng has felt closer to being whole than he has in a long time. A big part of that was – <em>is</em> – the other sect leader. Lan Xichen, whose shoulder he’s cried into more times than he’d like to admit; who saw his scars and said nothing beyond <em>they’re not your fault</em>; who let him scream and rant drunkenly and never once ran away.</p><p>Lan Xichen, who gives. Who lets other people take from him without thought to what it might cost him. He gives to everyone; he’s been giving to Jiang Cheng. That’s all it is.</p><p>It’s not right for Jiang Cheng to keep taking from him. Not when he knows he wants more than anyone should ever have to give, and Lan Xichen, for all his brilliance, still hasn’t learnt how to say ‘no’.</p><p>No matter how many people think Jiang Cheng to be the scum of the earth, he won’t take advantage of that. He’ll allow himself what he has now – he’s not strong enough to reject it – but he can’t have anything more.</p><p>As the thoughts circle through Jiang Cheng’s head, the knot in his chest pulls tighter. He can’t – he can’t stay here. Not right now. Not with his mind a mess and his body rebelling; there’s too much that could go wrong.</p><p>He stands on shaky legs, steadying himself quickly enough that it’s unnoticeable. Lan Xichen’s eyes follow him, the other man rising as well.</p><p>“I should go,” Jiang Cheng says, already turning towards the door. “It’s late.”</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” says Lan Xichen, almost hurriedly. His brows are drawn together, his face looking slightly pinched with concern.</p><p>Abruptly, Jiang Cheng is reminded of the day they visited the cold springs. He’d worn that same expression as Lan Xichen practically tripped over himself in his hurry to get away. He still doesn’t know what that was about, but even with their positions now reversed, it certainly wasn’t what Jiang Cheng is thinking now.</p><p>“I have work to do.” It comes out stiff – Jiang Cheng is a frankly terrible liar – but hopefully it’s enough to save him some face. He’s not running away; really, he isn’t. He actually does have work to do.</p><p>(Nevermind that writing letters to yell at his subordinates back in Yunmeng to scare them into actually working is only considered ‘work’ by the very loosest definition of the word.)</p><p>“Wanyin–” Lan Xichen tries, but before he can say anything else, Jiang Cheng has taken a page out of his book and run for the hills. Metaphorically, of course. They’re currently on the highest hill for miles.</p><p>Yes, he’s a coward. But it’s not like anyone actually expects good things from him at this point, so he’s disappointing no one. Except perhaps his mother, who’s probably cursing him out in the Nine Springs, where she’s also probably yelling at his father. Most likely concurrently.</p><p>Jiang Cheng reaches his rooms in record time, closes the door behind him and locks it for good measure. He has no idea what he’s running from – it’s not like Lan Xichen’s going to chase him. Gods, he really is a coward.</p><p>Although he supposes that by now, that’s the least of his problems.</p><p>His rooms are still a mess from the hissy fit he threw last night; and since they’re ever-so-kindly on loan from the administrators at Cloud Recesses, Jiang Cheng hasn’t had the heart (or any remote inclination) to report the damage. Thankfully, no one’s been by to clean them either.</p><p>There is, however, only so long he has before someone actually does, and when that happens, Jiang Cheng will be well and truly screwed.</p><p>He surveys the wreckage – the broken chair and desk, the empty wine jars – and sighs. Then he looks towards the bed, the only clear spot in the room. Thinks about another night left alone with his thoughts. His memories and nightmares; and now, the realisation that he’s gone and fucking fallen for Sect Leader Lan.</p><p>Jiang Cheng sighs again. Cleaning up it is.</p>

The book's super good, and if anyone is into steampunk, you should give it a go.

    <p>The day after that is…not easy for Jiang Cheng. The universe seems especially eager to shit on him (more so than usual, anyway) and so the first thing he discovers the next morning is that sometime in the night, his chest wound has reopened.</p><p>He wakes with his heart pounding and the phantom sensation of hands around his throat, opening his eyes to the sight of his newly extra-spartan room – having removed everything he’d broken last night (which was nearly everything) – and his bed’s white sheets stained with his own blood. His chest is throbbing like it’s being sheared open again, so he lies back until his head touches the pillow and feels very sorry for himself for about five minutes.</p><p>Then, well, the sheets are ruined. Obviously. Blood doesn’t just <em>come out</em> of white linen, no matter how well it’s scrubbed. Jiang Cheng sighs and hauls himself out of bed, biting back the groan that rises to his lips as his chest protests the sudden movement.</p><p>With quick, efficient movements, he strips the sheets from the bed and tosses them in a corner, making a mental note to procure new ones from whoever’s in charge of that here. These will have to be burnt. He sends up a silent prayer and is rewarded when a quick glance at the mattress reveals that it’s escaped relatively unscathed.</p><p>He’s not always this fortunate.</p><p>(He also wonders briefly if this is what being a woman feels like once a month. Ah-Jie had never complained, but she’d never complained about anything. Except childbirth, and she’d threatened to cut Jin Zixuan’s manhood off he ever made her go through it again.)</p><p>Then, of course, he has to change – seeing as his robes are even worse off than the sheets – and out of curiosity, unwraps the bandage underneath to take a look. The last layer comes away, still tacky with dried blood, exposing the wound to the air.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s grip goes slack. The bandages hit the floor with a wet ‘thud’.</p><p>Well, fuck.</p><p>It would have been too much to ask for, wouldn’t it, that this new injury be anywhere <em>normal</em> (relatively, at least) – on his chest, there’s plenty of other real estate available. It could jostle for position with all the other little scars he’s accumulated there over the years. But last night, when that undead bastard’s claws tore into his flesh, they’d run a near-perfect path across his torso. From shoulder to hip.</p><p>He looks in the mirror, and that fucking scar – the one that’s been tormenting him for seventeen years – looks back at him. Bright red and gouged open, like the first time he’d received it.</p><p>His fingers trace across the raised edges of the skin, newly split for the second time. Hard and ridged, not the spongy softness of ordinary flesh. It hadn’t felt like this last time – the first time – he’d woken up bleeding from this same place, chest hollow and empty. Everything had been cold without the warmth of his core.</p><p>He’d been colder still, once he remembered his family was gone.</p><p>The wound throbs again, and Jiang Cheng gasps. Retracts his fingers from where they’ve been pressing hard into the torn flesh without his permission.</p><p>“Don’t touch that,” he hisses to himself, and goes in search of something he can use for fresh bandages. He’s going to have to burn these too.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Of course, Jiang Cheng’s bad luck doesn’t end there. No – what would usually be the lowlight of an entire month turns out to set the tone for the rest of an exceptionally shitty day.</p><p>When he’s finally cleaned up enough to leave his rooms, it’s just past eight in the morning. And so the moment he opens the door, there Jin Ling is, standing in the hallway with his arms folded across his chest and tapping his foot.</p><p>“<em>Jiu-jiu</em>,” he says pettishly, “I thought you told me sleeping in was a bad idea.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng <em>so</em> isn’t in the mood to deal with Jin Ling’s crap right now. And he hadn’t slept in – let the brat try waking up covered in his own blood and cleaning up after himself. See if he’s still on time for breakfast.</p><p>(Actually, he’d rather his nephew <em>not</em> wake up covered in his own blood, so the point is kind of moot.)</p><p>He grunts and lets his face twist into the scowl it so badly wants to be.</p><p>“And <em>I</em> thought I told you to speak respectfully to your elders.”</p><p>“That’s a completely different point,” Jin Ling shoots back. Then he finally seems to get a good look at Jiang Cheng and does a double take. “Wow, Uncle, you look awful.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Jiang Cheng says drily, trying to ignore the sting of his pride. In all seriousness, though, he probably does look like shit. It still can’t be any worse than he feels.</p><p>“No, really. Where did you go last night? You look like you got run over by a horse.”</p><p>
  <em>Ouch.</em>
</p><p>Images of last night flash behind Jiang Cheng’s eyelids. The dead-eyed corpse with outstretched hands, bloated fingers reaching towards him. It’s all Jiang Cheng can do not to flinch.</p><p>“None of your gods-damned business,” he replies instead. Jin Ling rolls his eyes, and Jiang Cheng feels anger begin to grow in the pit of his stomach. But it doesn’t spread. Doesn’t seep into his veins and tint his vision hazy red. The realisation stops Jiang Cheng short.</p><p><em>Irritation</em>. That’s what it is. Or annoyance. Merely the faintest stirrings of anger, so much milder than the rage Jiang Cheng is used to.</p><p>It’s a foreign feeling. It’s been so long since Jiang Cheng has been familiar with any form of anger that isn’t blind rage; that doesn’t take him over completely until he can barely remember what it was that sparked it in the first place, and yet somehow can’t think of anything else.</p><p>Wow. That realisation should not be making Jiang Cheng feel as pathetic as it does.</p><p>Across from him, Jin Ling straightens up, peeling himself off the doorframe, and turns to walk in the direction of the main building. Jiang Cheng follows, albeit reluctantly.</p><p>Truth be told, Jiang Cheng currently wants nothing more than to be left alone in his room to brood and be pathetic and miserable in piece. And yet here his nephew is, dragging him outside so he can be pathetic and miserable in front of other people. Oh, joy of joys.</p><p>As they walk, a sense of dread, cold and heavy, settles over Jiang Cheng. It only worsens as the seconds tick by, and Jiang Cheng begins twisting Zidian around his finger before he even realises he’s doing it.</p><p>Jin Ling has begun chattering now, excited about something. Jiang Cheng isn’t sure what it is, but he catches his brother’s name. <em>Wei Wuxian</em>. Something inside Jiang Cheng tightens to the point of snapping.</p><p>At some point today, Jiang Cheng will undoubtedly run into his brother. In the corridors, at the mess hall – it doesn’t matter. They’ll meet, and Wei Wuxian will undoubtedly want to talk; to ask about his morning or gush about his husband. The thought of it makes Jiang Cheng feel like he’s running out of air.</p><p>Because this – today – will be the first time he talks to his brother after everything has been revealed. No more secrets, no discoveries or hidden sacrifices stuffed up their sleeves. Everything laid out on the table for the other to see. And though yesterday Jiang Cheng clung to his older brother, sobbed into his sleeve like a child, today he is uncertain.</p><p>Where do they stand now? He doesn’t know.</p><p>It’s like learning to fly on a sword above rocks instead of grass or sand. Mounting unsteady and wobbly, knowing that if you fall, the sharp rocks will tear all your squishy bits right open. Knowing too that at some point, you will fall.</p><p>It terrifies Jiang Cheng.</p><p>Not to mention the other thing. The one Jiang Cheng has been diligently avoiding thinking about all morning.</p><p>The Lan Xichen situation.</p><p>The moment the other sect leader’s name enters Jiang Cheng’s head, he curses internally. <em>Fuck</em>. Betrayed by his own mind, the backstabbing little shit.</p><p>He clenches his hands into fists and fights the urge to hit something. His nosy brat of a nephew would undoubtedly notice and demand to know what was going on, and Jiang Cheng doesn’t think he can explain it to him. How can he? He doesn’t even know himself.</p><p>All he can remember is last night, Lan Xichen’s head bent, candlelight playing over the planes of his cheeks, how fucking beautiful he’d been. The gentleness in his fingers as they smeared ointment on Jiang Cheng’s wounds, so mundane and practical and achingly tender all at once. The sense that Jiang Cheng’s world was shifting; the leaden feeling that had crawled inside him that was <em>want-want-want-but-can’t-have</em>, and the sting of the self-loathing that comes with coveting someone who will be forever and always too good for him.</p><p>Too good <em>to</em> him too, because Lan Xichen doesn’t know how to let people down gently. Doesn’t know how to let people down at all, and Jiang Cheng doesn’t think he’s yet learned how to say <em>no, I don’t want that</em> out loud. He has enough self-respect left not to want to be the first person to hear it.</p><p>They turn a corner, and the courtyard opens up before them. At the far end, through the throng of disciples, Jiang Cheng spots a figure in black, half-hanging on to a taller one in white. Wei Wuxian and his husband.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s heart begins to beat double-time.</p><p>As he watches, two more disciples in Gusu robes approach them, one gesticulating madly, the other calm and sedate. At the sight of them, Jin Ling lights up. His face breaks into a grin and his pace quickens.</p><p>Jiang Cheng stops dead.</p><p>Because one of those two disciples is Lan Sizhui. The Wen boy: Wen Yuan, or whatever his real name is.</p><p>All of a sudden, Jiang Cheng’s stomach clenches. The dread from before returns tenfold, crashing into him with the force of a charging bull and filling his lungs so he can barely breathe.</p><p>All he can think is <em>fuck</em>, his brain spitting curse words as loud as it can without releasing them into the air for everyone to hear. Because he promised he could do this. He’s apologised, he’s sworn to himself, his brother, his nephew that he could let this go. That he’d behave himself, act normally, and everything would be fine.</p><p>But how does one come back from that? How does one person say to another <em>you should be rotting in the ground</em> and expect to go on as if nothing had happened? Lan Sizhui might be a saint like his uncle, but Jiang Cheng sure as fuck isn’t.</p><p>For a moment, he looks at the boy who makes his nephew smile and tastes blood in his mouth. Hears screaming and feels heat on his face. Then he blinks, and it’s gone.</p><p>Of fucking <em>course</em> Jiang Cheng can’t let go. Almost twenty years it’s been, and he’d only promised a day ago.</p><p><em>I need more time</em>, he thinks desperately. Time, yes, is what he needs. Time, because everything’s shifting so fast and it’s all happening at once, and Jiang Cheng thinks he might be a little bit terrified of all this change.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has never been good at dealing with fear.</p><p>He knows instantly that if he stays, it will build and build and turn into anger and then to rage, and he will lash out again and say something he cannot take back. It’s what he does best, after all. That thought sparks fear too.</p><p>It’s the perfect excuse, and Jiang Cheng knows that he will later use this defense to explain away his cowardice, but for once he doesn’t fucking care. Everything that can go wrong is piling up in his head, and he just needs more time. Needs to be alone for a while, so he can be far away from everybody and hurt no one.</p><p>“Jin Ling,” he calls. The boy whirls around, the grin on his face fading somewhat when he catches sight of Jiang Cheng’s expression.</p><p>“Uncle? Is there something wrong?”</p><p>Jiang Cheng smoothes his features into what he hopes is a blank mask, but knows is more likely to look murderous. “I just remembered – a letter arrived from Yunmeng this morning. It’s not an emergency, but it’s urgent. I have to go back now.”</p><p>His nephew’s mouth drops open, clearly not expecting this turn of events.</p><p>“What? What is it?” His brow furrows. “Why are you leaving so suddenly – can’t it wait?”</p><p>“No,” Jiang Cheng says shortly, in a tone that brooks no argument. “It’s a clan matter. Don’t worry; I’ll just be gone for a few days. I’ll be back soon to finish the negotiations about your schooling.”</p><p>He turns and walks away before Jin Ling can recover, leaving his nephew standing in the middle of the courtyard, gaping. Then he gets the fuck out of Cloud Recesses.</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Lan Huan has his fingers half-tangled in his <em>guqin</em> when his brother enters the room. The strings vibrate, filling the room with a low hum. Lan Huan lays his hand on them to silence the noise.</p><p>“Morning, Wangji,” he says, giving his brother a sunny smile.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>It’s much the same as usual, but Wangji’s expression is odd. There’s a glint in his eye that Lan Huan rarely sees, and this time, he can’t discern what it means. He doesn’t look happy, though. Almost…disappointed.</p><p>“Has something happened?”, he asks slowly, drawing a finger along Yongwan’s strings in a chord he knows Wangji likes.</p><p>Wangji’s eyelid twitches. It’s barely perceptible, but Lan Huan catches it. That’s not good, not at all. “Jiang Cheng has left.”</p><p>Lan Huan’s finger jerks. The chord goes off-key.</p>

  <em>Dear Jiang Wanyin:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>How are you? Wangji tells me you’ve returned to Lotus Pier. <strike>You left so suddenly</strike> <strike>I was worried</strike> Is everything all right?</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your nephew came by yesterday. He wanted to know if something had happened – seemed to think we’d been in contact. He asked me to ask you if you’re coming back soon, and I told him I would, so here I am. <strike>I hope you will too</strike> We still have much to discuss; I hope we’ll have the opportunity to finish our conversations soon.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Greatest regards,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lan Xichen</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Jiang Wanyin:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s been four days since you left. Did you receive my letter? I can hardly tell, since there was no reply. I hope you did. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Young Master Jin has been visiting every day now. He’s very <strike>concerned</strike> worried about you. I’m sorry to say I haven’t been able to be of much help in comforting him – he keeps asking after you, and I don’t have anything to tell him. <strike>Please answer me so I can.</strike></em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your brother has been visiting too with Wangji. I’m not entirely sure why everyone seems to think I know what’s going on – was it something I said? <strike>I’m sorry</strike> Please forgive me if it was; I didn’t mean to offend you.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>How are things in Yunmeng? Your nephew has told me that you had to rush back for an emergency, but I haven’t been able to hear anything. I hope it’s been resolved. If it hasn’t, you can tell me about it if you want.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>As always,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lan Xichen</em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <strike> </strike>
  </em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Jiang Wanyin:</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Nothing much has changed here in the last week. Your nephew has asked me if he could sit in on some of Shu-Fu’s classes before he starts his formal enrollment with the new cohort of disciples. I hope you don’t mind that I’ve agreed. Shu-Fu tells me he is a very attentive student, if a little <strike>too blunt</strike> straightforward. Personally, I think that’s a good quality to have, especially in a future sect leader. </em>
</p><p>
  <em>Young Master Wei is still asking after you, but I think he might know more than he’s letting on about your <strike>silence</strike> sudden departure. I hope that whatever he knows, it’s that you’re all right.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I don’t know if you’re even getting these letters. Or if you are, if you’re reading them at all. You told me that you don’t like reading letters, but I have to try.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Today I went to sit by the pond behind the cottage – the one with the lotuses in it that you like so much. The ducks came up to me, even though I hardly ever feed them. I think they remember you. Or perhaps they remember your rice crackers.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I miss our conversations. It’s <strike>lonely</strike> quiet now. Quieter than it was before, and I think I’ve been making too much tea. Swearing more too. You’ve been a horrible influence. I blame you for this.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Am I saying too much? Well, if this letter doesn’t reach you, it will hardly matter anyway. If it does, well, please reply. You can tell me to shut up if you want.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>It’s probably foolish of me to ramble on like this. I don’t know what’s going on in Yunmeng right now. You could be facing a crisis, and here I am talking about ducks. I hope you’re not – facing a crisis, that is. I hope you’re all right.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But if you are in trouble, please write back. I promise to help in any way I can.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Your friend,</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Lan Xichen</em>
</p><p>
  <em> </em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jiang Cheng scrubs at his face and sighs, Lan Xichen’s latest letter clutched in his hand as it has been for the past ten minutes. The rest of them sit in a neat pile at the corner of his desk.</p><p>Fucking pathetic, that’s what he is. It’s been nearly two weeks since he left Cloud Recesses. In that time, he hasn’t replied to a single one of Lan Xichen’s letters, yet he knows the contents of each of them by heart. Has read them all at least five times, maybe six.</p><p>There was a letter from Jin Ling, too, that arrived three days ago. Written in the brat’s stupidly fancy calligraphy and filthy language that he <em>definitely</em> hadn’t learned from Jiang Cheng, demanding to know what the hell his uncle is doing that’s taking so long. Jiang Cheng hasn’t answered that one either.</p><p>To be completely honest, yes, Jiang Cheng’s been hiding. There it is, out in the open. He’s acknowledged that much, at least. Has that much self-awareness.</p><p>It’s so fucking stupid, because he should be done with this by now. Should have pulled himself together and gone back to Cloud Recesses, finished working out Jin Ling’s enrollment and said goodbye like nothing was wrong. Yet here he is, still in Lotus Pier two weeks later, because every time he thinks about Lan Xichen’s smile – the soft, happy one he reserves for people who know the one he wears in public is a mask – his heart goes right back to feeling as though it’s about to beat out of his chest, and Jiang Cheng goes right back to thinking he’s going to die if he ever sees it again.</p><p>And still, every time he thinks of <em>not</em> seeing it again, about going the rest of his life without ever getting to make Lan Xichen laugh, or crack one of those stupid dirty jokes that don’t even have a punchline, Jiang Cheng thinks that too might kill him. Gods, he’s a mess.</p><p>So here he is, stuck in this strange limbo, hovering between going back and staying in Lotus Pier for the rest of his life and never coming out again. All the while reading and rereading Lan Xichen’s letters over and over, hearing the words in his voice.</p><p>If he thought that would make it better, he was an idiot. Because Lan Xichen isn’t even mad that Jiang Cheng just up and disappeared on him when he said he’d stay, just worried and sending letters that always go unanswered, and Jiang Cheng is still so fucking in love with him he thinks he might cry.</p><p>He shouldn’t even have left Cloud Recesses in the first place, Jiang Cheng thinks bitterly. Coward that he is. He should have just stayed there, stuck it out like the good friend he swore he’d be, helped Lan Xichen take his first steps out of seclusion, and <em>then</em> gone back to his own life. To his quiet study full of shit that doesn’t break when he throws it, and his desk piled with letters from his Council asking him when the hell he’s going to start making heirs.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, he’d send letters to Lan Xichen sometimes. Keep up a correspondence, stay friends, and be glad to be able to be that much. That would be nice.</p><p>Instead he’s gone and ruined it.</p><p>The wound on Jiang Cheng’s chest twinges as he thinks it. It’s almost healed but not quite – Lan Xichen did a good job, but since then, Jiang Cheng hasn’t allowed anyone to look at it other than himself. Can’t stand anyone else knowing how badly he’s fucked up.</p><p>It hits him then, that this is how he behaves with people he loves. Wei Wuxian, who he pushed away all those years ago, alienating Ah-Jie too by extension. Jin Ling, who he shouts at constantly and has praised maybe three times in his life. And now this…this <em>thing</em> he feels for Lan Xichen.</p><p>If this is how he acts, if this is what he does, he can’t go on like this. Can’t ever get married and become someone’s husband, can’t ever have children of his own and become someone’s father. He can’t do that to somebody else – somebody unconnected with him who hasn’t yet been dragged into the disaster that is Jiang Cheng’s life.</p><p>Jiang Cheng looks down at his hands and sets Lan Xichen’s letter back on the table with the rest of the pile. He takes Zidian off, rolls it between his fingers. Considering.</p><p>Then he pulls out a blank sheet of paper, picks up his calligraphy brush, and begins to write.</p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>“There was never any ‘urgent letter’, was there?” Jin Ling asks, sprawled out on the ground in what he’s come to think of as ‘their spot’, just for the three of them.</p><p>Jingyi, hanging from a tree branch, snorts and smoothes his robes up over his knees. They fall instantly the moment he removes his hands to flop down near his chin, and his crestfallen look is even dumber upside-down than it is normally.</p><p>“You said he just up and left when you were halfway to the courtyard,” says Jingyi. “Does it sound like there was one to you?”</p><p>The weight on Jin Ling’s lap lifts as Sizhui sits up to fix them both with one of his patented disapproving looks.</p><p>“Knock it off, you two. We’ve been over this.”</p><p>“Yeah,” replies Jingyi, completely missing the point. “We’ve established enough times that your uncle lied to you so he could get out of dodge and go camp out back home. You don’t need to keep asking us if he did.”</p><p>“Jingyi–”, Sizhui warns, his voice going lower.</p><p>“Look, I’m just stating the facts here. Which are: Sect Leader Jiang ditched you without a plausible explanation as to why, and now he isn’t responding to anyone’s letters and no one can contact him. That’s all I’m saying.” Jingyi gives up trying to fix his robes and reaches up to grab the branch with both hands. He wriggles off and drops back down to the ground, landing neatly on both feet.</p><p>Jin Ling feels pressure begin to build behind his eyes. One of his eyelids twitches. His friend isn’t wrong, which is the problem. <em>Jiu-jiu</em> really is being an idiot.</p><p>“Why the fuck would he leave, though?”, he asks out loud. “I don’t get it. Everything was fine the day before, and then he just up and left. Nothing happened.”</p><p>An eyeroll from Jingyi is his answer. “Well, clearly, something happened. Anyway, one of the juniors on gate duty the night before Sect Leader Jiang left told me that he went out with Zewu-Jun. They came back after curfew, apparently.”</p><p>“Hang on,” Jin Ling interrupts. “I don’t get it – isn’t Zewu-Jun supposed to be in seclusion? What does he keep leaving for?”</p><p>Sizhui turns to face him. His expression is somber, and Jin Ling realises that he has hit a sore spot with his question.</p><p>“He <em>is</em> in seclusion. The same kind as Qingheng-Jun, his father, was before he died. Hanguang-Jun says he spent over twenty years in that cottage. Never came out, not once. And last year, I heard some of the elders talking about how it looked as though Zewu-Jun would do the same. Whatever Sect Leader Jiang was doing, it was good.”</p><p>“He needs to keep doing it.” Jingyi continues on from his best friend’s words, nodding. His usual goofy grin seems more subdued than usual. “Zewu-Jun is really torn-up about him leaving. Hasn’t left the cottage since. He keeps sending letters to Yunmeng, and I’ve never once seen him get a reply.”</p><p><em>Hang on.</em> Jin Ling’s eyebrows draw together. Even he gave up writing after his first letter failed to receive a response. His uncle clearly doesn’t want to be talked to. Yet Zewu-Jun is still trying – how does that figure?</p><p>An image asserts itself in Jin Ling’s memory. The Lan sect leader, reaching out to lay a hand on <em>Jiu-jiu</em>’s shoulder. At the time, Jin Ling remembers thinking <em>Jiu-jiu</em> was going to cut the other man’s hand off. He would have, Jin Ling knows with certainty. Yet his uncle barely twitched. Didn’t even utter any threats.</p><p>From the look on Sizhui’s face, he’s thinking of that too. Or something like it.</p><p>“You think something happened between them?”, Jin Ling’s boyfriend asks. He has a pensive look on his face. Jin Ling knows that look – he’s planning something.</p><p>“Well, if it did, it’s got to be <em>Jiu-jiu</em>’s fault. I know what he looks like when he’s angry, and this isn’t it.”</p><p>“What happened to filial piety?” This is clearly entertaining to Jingyi. Jin Ling is suddenly possessed by the urge to wipe the smirk off his face.</p><p>He calms only when Sizhui nudges him. Then he ignores Jingyi completely, continuing to think out loud, hoping one of his friends will pick up on his train of thought.</p><p>“He’s not very good at dealing with feelings,” Jin Ling decides.</p><p>“Yeah, no shit.”</p><p>“Shut up, you dumb chicken wing.”</p><p>“Wait wait wait, hold up a second. You’re saying your uncle, Sect Leader Jiang, Sandu-Shengshou, whatever – you’re saying he ran away from Cloud Recesses because he was <em>scared</em>?”</p><p>Jin Ling leans forward, intent on smacking him. Jingyi and his stupid fucking leaps of logic. Never makes any sense. He opens his mouth to disagree. Then he freezes.</p><p>“Oh, shit,” he mutters. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you have a point.”</p><p>And then he immediately regrets it when Jingyi gives the worst leer he’s ever seen in his life. “Are you actually admitting that I’m right?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Jing Ling says again instead of answering. “Now, what are we going to do about it? I know you have a plan.”</p><p>“Acknowledge my amazingness, and then I’ll tell you.”</p><p>Jin Ling punches him in the arm.</p>

    <p>“I can’t believe I agreed to this.” Jin Ling stares down at his hands, trying to ignore the movement at the corners of his vision, where Jingyi is gesturing animatedly as he goes on about the stupidest plan ever created in the history of stupid plans.</p><p>Sizhui pats his back sympathetically, though he makes no move to shut Jingyi up. “It’s for the greater good.”</p><p>“Easy for you to say,” Jin Ling moans miserably, wondering where his entire life went wrong. It was probably around the time of his birth, to be honest. “It’s not <em>your </em>uncle we’re suckering into this.”</p><p>Jingyi pauses in his chattering to shoot him a significant look.</p><p>“Actually, it kind of is.” Jin Ling hits him again.</p><p>“I will sic Fairy on you if you don’t shut up,” he warns. It’s not even a threat at his point – Jin Ling is genuinely ready to do it. To hell with Lanling-Gusu relations.</p><p>Actually, on second thought, it might not be such a great idea. For one, it might make Sizhui sad if Jin Ling were to murder his best friend in cold blood.</p><p>“You shut up,” Jingyi retorts. “I’m trying to write here. You’re blocking my creative flow.”</p><p>The words are garbled; the other boy has stuck the end of his calligraphy brush into his mouth and is chewing on it thoughtfully. Ink wells at the tip. Jin Ling considers telling him it’s about to drip on his robes but decides against it. Let him look stupid.</p><p>Unfortunately for that plan, Sizhui reaches over and deftly plucks it out of Jingyi’s mouth, ignoring the indignant ‘hey!’ he lets out as his teeth clack together.</p><p>“That’s unsanitary,” Jin Ling’s boyfriend informs him. “Don’t put inedible objects in your mouth.”</p><p>It’s like he’s talking to a five-year-old. A pout works its way onto Jingyi’s features, and Jin Ling has to muffle an undignified snort. Sometimes, he thinks, it’s as though the two Lan boys share a brain. Like on night hunts, when they work almost perfectly in tandem, Jingyi slashing with his sword as Sizhui backs him up with attacks using his <em>guqin</em>.</p><p>Other times, however, Jin Ling is convinced that their shared brain belongs exclusively to Sizhui. Like today, except that now that he thinks about it, Sizhui might have lost his mind too, if Jingyi’s hygiene – or lack thereof – is the only thing about this situation he finds concerning.</p><p>Wordlessly, Sizhui hands Jingyi back the brush. Jin Ling lets out a long-suffering sigh. He’s getting pretty good at those.</p><p>“Well, if we’re going to do this, we may as well do it properly. Show me what we’ve got so far,” he commands, holding out his hand for the paper. Jingyi passes it to him and he scans it quickly.</p><p>It’s written in calligraphy. Jin Ling should be used to it by now, but somehow it’s always a shock how neat Jingyi’s handwriting is. For some reason, Jin Ling always expects his work to look like chickenscratch. It’s a jolt to be faced with irredeemable proof that behind his ridiculous exterior, his friend is also very much a Lan.</p><p>Still, the contents of the paper itself make the hairs on the back of Jin Ling’s neck prickle.</p><p>
  <em>…I confess that I feel drawn to you somehow… this pull between us… your eyes are like the shine of stars on the lake at night…</em>
</p><p>With a snort of disgust, Jin Ling throws the paper back at Jingyi. He forgets to crumple it first though, so it’s barely left his hand before it veers off to the right and drifts to the floor. He makes the move to pick it up again – to throw it properly this time – but Jingyi dives for it and scoops it up first, hugging the paper to his chest protectively.</p><p>“What the fuck, Jingyi?”, Jin Ling screeches. He thinks he might have thrown up in his mouth a little. “That’s disgusting!”</p><p>“It’s art! Poetry!”</p><p>“You can’t send this to my uncle! No – <em>we</em> can’t send this to my uncle. I won’t allow it.” Jin Ling crosses his arms in front of his chest and scowls, trying to channel that look <em>Jiu-jiu</em> has when he’s pissed off. The one he once saw, on a particularly memorable occasion, make one of the Council members start crying.</p><p>It doesn’t quite seem to work, however, because Jingyi opens his mouth to retort, “just because you have no artistic sensibilities doesn’t mean no one else will appreciate it!”</p><p>That’s it. Jin Ling feels the blood beginning to rush to his face. Suddenly, Sizhui lays a hand on both him and Jingyi, gripping their shoulders tight.</p><p>“Calm down, both of you,” he says in his most placating tone.</p><p>All of a sudden, Jin Ling feels a rush of sympathy for his poor boyfriend. He’s had to do this every day now – be the responsible one, get between Jin Ling and his best friend when they’re near coming to blows. He’s giving them both the <em>look</em> now. Puppy-dog eyes and a long-suffering expression.</p><p>Jin Ling’s heart softens a little, and he feels the inexplicable urge to apologise and make nice with Jingyi. But no, he thinks, shaking himself. He’s not backing down on this one. Absolutely not.</p><p>He sucks in a deep breath, forcing his tone lower and softer anyway so he won’t disappoint Sizhui, and looks Jingyi in the face. Then, in his most serious voice, he says, “we’re not sending that to my uncle.”</p><p>“Why not? What’s wrong with it?”</p><p>Jingyi’s tilting his head now, giving him that confused-bird look that reminds Jin Ling that he doesn’t <em>always</em> want to punch him in the face. What an idiot. Alright, Jin Ling tells himself, it’s his responsibility to teach the other boy some common sense. Gods know he doesn’t come by it naturally.</p><p>“First,” he says, “Zewu-Jun would <em>never</em> write this. It’s got to be convincing, dumbass.”</p><p>Jingyi lets out a half-hearted ‘hey’ at the insult, but even he can tell there’s no heat in it. Silently, Sizhui pokes him, and the younger Lan boy passes him the letter, by now crumpled and creased.</p><p>“Second,” Jin Ling continues, watching as Sizhui’s eyes scan the words and his brows draw closer together the longer he reads, “even if we managed to convince <em>Jiu-jiu</em> that Zewu-Jun really did write it, the first page alone would make him lock himself inside Lotus Pier and never come out.”</p><p>“Is it that bad?”, Jingyi asks mournfully.</p><p>Jin Ling is suddenly forcefully reminded of when he was nine, watching Fairy try to run down the stairs and fail miserably. She landed in a heap at the bottom, and the look in her eyes was exactly the same as Jingyi is wearing now. The urge to giggle rises in Jin Ling’s throat; he forces it down with an effort.</p><p>It’s not his friend’s fault that Ouyang-Zizhen keeps shipping over whole boxes of romance novels, he reminds himself sternly. At least Jingyi’s trying to help.</p><p>Instead of answering directly, he replies, “you wrote a whole paragraph about his eyes.”</p><p>Jingyi shrinks in on himself. At that precise moment, Sizhui raises his head from where he’s got it bent close to the letter, examining the words.</p><p>“It’s two, actually,” he remarks. “Jingyi, I think we need to have a serious talk about your choice of reading material.”</p><p>The pink on Jingyi’s cheeks is unmistakable. He’s blushing furiously now, and Jin Ling can’t help it. A laugh bubbles out of him. Then another, and another, and soon he’s shaking uncontrollably, wrapping his hands around his middle when it starts to hurt from all the laughing.</p><p>“Are- are you sure–” he gasps between breaths, stuttering with the force of the hilarity, “– are you sure you’re writing this on Zewu-Jun’s behalf? Not– not yours?”</p><p>If possible, Jingyi’s face flames even redder.</p><p>It really is supremely fucking funny, the calm part of Jin Ling reflects even as the rest of him rolls around on the floor, probably shredding every hint of dignity he owns. Even Sizhui raises a hand to his mouth, hiding a smile behind his sleeve. Jin Ling can see his shoulders shaking with the effort of not laughing out loud.</p><p>“Stop it guys, please,” Jingyi begs, unable to take the teasing any longer. “I will literally pay you to stop laughing.”</p><p>Jin Ling only laughs harder.</p><p>“Come on, it’s a love letter,” the Lan boy protests. “Those are supposed to be romantic, right?”</p><p>Finally, Jin Ling manages to get himself under control. He forces himself to breathe normally, allowing only a few stray snorts to escape. They still have to work this out.</p><p>By now, Sizhui has put the letter down and is looking at the both of them with barely-contained amusement.</p><p>“I don’t know why you’re so smug,” Jingyi continues, turning to glare half-heartedly at his best friend. “You’re the best at forging Zewu-Jun’s handwriting; you’re going to be the one who has to write the final copy.”</p><p>Sizhui only shrugs.</p><p>“What, you have a better idea?”</p><p>The older boy shrugs again, and Jin Ling turns his head around to look at his boyfriend so fast he nearly gives himself whiplash. By now, both he and Jingyi are staring expectantly at Sizhui, waiting for some stroke of genius from the person who is admittedly probably the most intelligent of their little group.</p><p>“How about–” he begins, cutting himself short when he realises that all eyes are now on him. Then he takes a deep breath and tries again. “How about… <em>I would be a bird flying beside you in the sky; I would be a tree growing beside yours in the earth</em>?”</p><p>There’s a pause when Sizhui finishes. He looks at both of them expectantly, a hopeful look on his face that makes Jin Ling grab the back of his neck and pull him into a closed-mouth kiss. Then he pulls back, and exchanges a glance with Jingyi.</p><p>“I think,” Jingyi says sagely, “that you should stick to composing music. Poetry is clearly not your thing.”</p><p>Sizhui winces. Now it’s Jin Ling’s turn to pat him on the back sympathetically. He has to agree with Jingyi on this one. Jin Ling hates to ask, but he has to.</p><p>“Did you just–”</p><p>“Yes,” Jingyi replies. “Yes, he did just adapt <em>Changhen-Ge</em> to write a love letter.”</p><p>“Correct me if I’m wrong,” Jin Ling asks again, “but doesn’t Yang-Guifei die in this poem?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And the emperor is about a hundred years older than her?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And the last line is about neverending resentment?”</p><p>“Yes,” Jingyi replies firmly.</p><p>Sizhui looks betrayed. “It’s romantic,” he protests, ducking his head as both his companions turn to look at him again. “Their love story is a classic.”</p><p>But Jingyi is shaking his head, and Jin Ling has to struggle not to laugh again. Instead, he lays his head on his boyfriend’s shoulder.</p><p>“Their love story ruined the whole country,” he corrects. It’s physically painful for him to say this, because now Sizhui looks so <em>sad</em> that it makes Jin Ling’s chest ache, but honestly. Clearly, Sizhui has been spending way too much time around Wei Wuxian and his sappy, sappy bullshit.</p><p>“Well, what do <em>you</em> suggest, then?” Sizhui asks, sounding more than a little put-out. Privately, Jin Ling thinks it’s cute. The older boy is always so competent, so unerringly good at everything; it’s nice to be reminded sometimes that there are things he’s not naturally talented at. That he’s imperfect too, and somehow that makes Jin Ling love him even more.</p><p>Still, now that both Jingyi and Sizhui have tried their hands at this, Jin Ling really does have to do something constructive.</p><p>“Well,” he says, considering, “it might help if we actually considered their personalities a little more. Like, what Zewu-Jun might actually write. Or what has the best chance of getting through to Uncle.”</p><p>Jingyi frowns. “Which is?”</p><p>“How am I supposed to know?”</p><p>“You’re the one who lives with him!”</p><p>Jin Ling sighs. “I still think this is a stupid plan.”</p>

          <p>Hey everyone! This chapter was a little bit of a filler, but something I wanted to write for fun, because it was a blast. Our Idiot Trio is SO much fun to write. I love them so much.</p><p>If anyone wants to know, the poem referenced in this chapter is Changhen-Ge, a.k.a. 'The Song of Lasting Resentment'. This poem was a big part of my childhood, 'cause my mom insisted that we learn it when I was about eight, and it gave eight-year-old me so many headaches. I'm sorry to anyone who likes this poem if I've butchered it - my Chinese translation skills are not fantastic, and the line referenced here is a loose adaptation at best - I just couldn't resist throwing it in here.</p><p>If you've never heard of it before, just a quick summary: the poem is about one of the emperors, who fell in love with a young girl from one of the noble families and made her his concubine. This girl was Yang-Guifei, one of the Four Great Beauties of ancient China. The emperor loved her so much that he neglected all his other concubines and began to neglect his court as well. This, like most famous love stories, ends in tragedy: the officials, fed up with the emperor's lack of participation in his own government, demanded that Yang-Guifei be executed. As you can probably guess, she was. I can't remember the end of the poem very well, but I think what happened is that the emperor was so devastated that he employed someone to visit the spirit world (he had to travel to both heaven and hell) to look for Yang-Guifei's spirit and tell him how she was doing. Please correct me if I'm wrong. </p><p>Anyway, it's an amazing poem. Please feel free to look it up online. And as always, have a great day!</p>

    <p>Jiang Cheng looks up from yet another letter and sighs. He’s been doing that a lot lately. He pinches the bridge of his nose between two fingers, knowing it won’t do much good against the throbbing that’s been building between his temples for the past fifteen minutes.</p><p>The paper in his hand is thick, watermarked with a nine-petaled lotus. It’s the same kind of paper Jiang Cheng himself uses for official missives, and the irony of it sticks in his throat. Of course, it’s not just Jiang Cheng who uses it, clearly, as evidenced by the squawking of his Council written down in so many pretty, calligraphed words.</p><p>He’d anticipated as much when he’d penned down this latest decision. Knew his Council, hidebound traditionalists as they were, would fucking hate it. There would be an uproar. Strangely, that had just made him want to do it more.</p><p><em>You asked for this</em>, he reminds himself as he picks up the letter again, steeling himself for another read-through before he finally decides how best to respond to this shitstorm he’s invited upon himself. Truthfully, though he made the decision in a split-second, this had been a long time coming, burning at the back of his mind for years before he’d finally managed to gather the guts to do it.</p><p>But before Jiang Cheng can subject himself to the bullshit his Council is spouting once more, a knock comes on the door. Soft and undemanding, but authoritative nonetheless – one of the servants. Jiang Cheng’s headache intensifies.</p><p>“What is it,” he snaps, uncaring of his harsh tone. The staff is damn well used to it by now.</p><p>Almost immediately, the door slides open. Quietly though, because even the most headstrong servants know not to make too much noise when Jiang Cheng gets like this, locking himself in his study for hours on end. Especially not now, when even Jiang Cheng himself is aware that he’s been pissier than normal.</p><p>A maid enters the room and bows, her gray head dipping towards the floor. Her hands are clasped behind her back. She stands at attention, same as the disciples do on the training field when waiting for instructions.</p><p>“Young Master Wei is here to see you, sir.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng swallows around the sudden lump in his throat that no, absolutely does <em>not</em> have anything to do with panic. Of course his brother would show up. Of fucking <em>course</em>.</p><p>The meddling asshole. Jiang Cheng focuses on that thought instead; feels the lump go away and irritation rise up to take its place. It burns steadily, low in his gut – a welcome feeling.</p><p>“I told you I would not be receiving visitors,” he forces out from between teeth he didn’t know he was clenching. “Tell him to leave, if you haven’t already.”</p><p>The maid only looks exasperated. “We’ve tried that, sir. But he’s just not taking no for an answer–”</p><p>Before she can finish, the door slides open again. This time, it hits the doorframe with a loud ‘thud’ that Jiang Cheng <em>feels</em> in his skull. The woman’s mouth clamps shut, and she bows towards the newcomer, who strides into the room like he owns the place.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>, Jiang Cheng thinks with feeling.</p><p>“Don’t bow,” he directs at the maid, who jerks back up at the sound of his voice. “He doesn’t deserve it.”</p><p>At the far end of the room, the maid looks like she’s about to roll her eyes. She restrains herself – barely – bows to Jiang Cheng once more and retreats from the room. Smart woman.</p><p>Wei Wuxian, however, doesn’t look offended in the least. He flashes his signature grin, the one with all his teeth that used to make all the village girls swoon. For once, surprisingly, Jiang Cheng isn’t caught off-guard by how it looks on Mo Xuanyu’s face, thinner than Wei Wuxian’s own, with those huge eyes and sharp chin. He must be getting used to it, he thinks. The thought only elicits a mild pang in his chest.</p><p>“You know,” he says conversationally, “you never officially removed me from Yunmeng’s annals. I checked: I’m still a disciple here. Which means I have the right to come and visit any time I want.”</p><p>“It also means that your conduct comes under my jurisdiction. So <em>I</em> have the right to tell you to get out of Lotus Pier and fuck off right back to Cloud Recesses.”</p><p>The vehemence in Jiang Cheng’s own voice surprises him. He sees the effect it has on his brother too, who shifts backwards just a little. It’s jarring. It feels like being plunged into cold water, and Jiang Cheng almost apologises right there.</p><p>Except Wei Wuxian has never been afraid of him. Perhaps it’s a lifetime of outshining Jiang Cheng in everything the two of them ever tried, perhaps it’s just that they grew up together and Wei Wuxian knows Jiang Cheng maybe better than Jiang Cheng knows himself. But his older brother has never once feared him.</p><p>So even though surprise flickers across his face, it disappears just as quickly as it came. A smile comes down over it, and the look is lost.</p><p>“Ah, but you forget,” says Wei Wuxian, wagging a finger at him like he’s chastising a child throwing a tantrum, “I’m also technically a member of the Lan clan. It’s called diplomatic immunity, little brother. Which means I can do whatever I want.”</p><p>“That’s not how inter-sect relations work,” Jiang Cheng protests. He can feel it already, them slipping back into the roles from their childhood. Him as the stick-in-the-mud, whiny younger brother; Wei Wuxian as the smiling, world-wise elder.</p><p>He fucking hates it. Hates how even now, it feels as easy as breathing. How gods-damn comfortable it is.</p><p>But he doesn’t have time to dwell on that, thank the gods, because Wei Wuxian’s expression quickly turns serious. The smile fades from his face and his gaze shifts away from Jiang Cheng, taking in the rest of the room.</p><p>Jiang Cheng flushes hot. He knows his study’s a mess. He’s been here over ten hours a day every day for the past two weeks, taken his meals in here, spent every spare moment in here that he hasn’t been in the training fields with his disciples or beating on practice dummies until they fall apart at the seams. Hell, he hasn’t even allowed any of the servants in here to clean, which in hindsight, may have been a mistake.</p><p>His brother doesn’t mention any of that. Instead, his eyes alight on Jiang Cheng’s desk. On the piles and piles of paper, all the correspondences with his Council and the representatives sent to the villages across Yunmeng. And Lan Xichen’s letters.</p><p>Jiang Cheng knows the moment Wei Wuxian realises what they are, because a light goes on behind his eyes and he stares at them for a long moment before finally tearing his gaze away to look right at Jiang Cheng. There’s something in his face – something solemn and understanding. This time, Jiang Cheng, who’s had decades of practice reading his brother, has to look away.</p><p>Of course he has to. Everything is there, right there on the table. Lan Xichen’s letters stacked high, one sent every day. Each one spread neatly open, the lines of the folds nearly gone with how often Jiang Cheng’s smoothed over them as he reads. And Wei Wuxian has always been too damn perceptive for his own good.</p><p>“You have been getting our letters,” the older man says softly. Suddenly, Jiang Cheng realises his hands are trembling. Jin Ling’s letter is in the pile too. Jiang Cheng’s a little ashamed of how often he’s read it.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I know, you know.” That sentence is so patently ridiculous, so perfectly Wei Wuxian, that it knocks something loose inside Jiang Cheng, something tight and wound-up. He becomes aware that he’s been holding his breath, and it all comes out in a rush.</p><p>“You know?” The words are weak. Shaky, and Jiang Cheng aches with how much he hates himself in this moment. Of course his brother knows. Jiang Cheng’s always been easy to read, so transparent that everyone he’s ever met has been able to see right through him. Die never liked that about him.</p><p>“Yeah.” Wei Wuxian pauses. Then, abruptly, he brings a hand up to rest on Jiang Cheng’s shoulder, awkward and kind of heavy, like he doesn’t know what to do with it. Jiang Cheng lets him. It surprises both of them. “It’s kind of obvious.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng doesn’t know how to respond to that. In all honesty, he doesn’t know how to respond to a lot of things. It’s what landed him in this mess to begin with. He’s not irritated anymore, really. Just tired.</p><p>“You look like shit,” Wei Wuxian says, out of the blue. “You haven’t been sleeping, have you? I’ve seen tent-carrying bags smaller than the ones under your eyes.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng would be offended if he didn’t know it was true. He hasn’t been sleeping. Every time he tries, he just starts thinking of Lan Xichen’s face, his smile, the warmth in his eyes. The warmth of him where he’d fallen asleep against Jiang Cheng that night on the roof, when he’d gotten drunk.</p><p>“Fuck you,” he shoots back instead. It doesn’t carry the heat it should, and they both know it.</p><p>The ghost of a smile flickers across Wei Wuxian’s face for a second, before it turns solemn again.</p><p>“He looks like shit, too.” He doesn’t say who <em>he</em> is. He doesn’t need to. “Your leaving, whatever it is you’re doing here – it’s hitting him hard. Lan Zhan’s furious – he says he doesn’t even know what he did wrong.”</p><p>And there it is. The thing Jiang Cheng has been trying so damn hard to avoid these past two weeks. Training, doing paperwork, meditating – all of it has been to keep from thinking about just what exactly he’d done when he’d run out of the Cloud Recesses after that night.</p><p>“He didn’t do anything wrong.”</p><p>“Then you get your ass back there and tell him that, you idiot. Don’t leave him in the lurch like this – this is shitty, even for you.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s mouth is pressed into a line, so hard his lips have lost nearly all their colour. He’s serious about this. It’s a low blow, meant to cut, but Jiang Cheng takes it anyway. He doesn’t fight; he knows he deserves it.</p><p>“He’s completely gone on you.” His older brother speaks again, this time jerking his head towards the desk where all the letters are. “And you love throwing shit away, so don’t try to convince me you don’t feel the same way, because if you do try it, so help me <em>Guanyin-Ma</em> I will smack you so hard you will see <em>stars</em>–”</p><p>He must see something in Jiang Cheng’s face when he doesn’t answer, because Wei Wuxian stops talking. Takes a deep breath and blows it out through his mouth like a little kid. Then, when he’s gathered himself, he opens his mouth.</p><p>“I know our childhood fucked you up,” he says bluntly, and Jiang Cheng’s jaw drops because in the more-than-three decades he’s been alive, no one in his family has ever admitted that. Not even hinted at it. “It fucked all of us up, even me and Shi-Jie.”</p><p>And strangest of all, the mention of their sister from Wei Wuxian’s mouth doesn’t make his blood boil like it used to. Jiang Cheng turns now to look at him fully, meeting his eyes.</p><p>“But it’s been years. She moved on. Fell in love and made herself a family, even if it didn’t last as long as she deserved. I’ve moved on too, with Lan Zhan and Ah-Yuan.”</p><p>Every word feels like a needle against Jiang Cheng’s skin. It stings, this reminder of everything he doesn’t have, has never earned, even if his brother doesn’t mean it that way. But something tells him he does, because Wei Wuxian has never shied away from hurting Jiang Cheng for his own good. The core in his chest proves that much.</p><p>“It’s your turn now, Jiang Cheng. You’ve got a good thing going here, and I know it makes you happy. <em>He </em>makes you happy – happier than I’ve ever seen you. I know it’s scary as fuck, but you shouldn’t run away. It’s your turn to move on.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng will never admit it, but the noise he lets out then is midway between a gasp and a sob. It’s all the sound he can spare, because his throat’s closed up and his eyes sting, and he doesn’t trust himself not to actually start crying if he tries to speak. He nods.</p><p>And just like that, the grin spreads back over Wei Wuxian’s face, though his eyes are misty. His hand tightens on Jiang Cheng’s shoulder.</p><p>“Good,” he says cheerfully. His voice only wavers a little. “Now that that’s settled, I’m dragging you back to the Cloud Recesses with me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You would not <em>believe</em> the time I’ve had. I had to stop the kids from sending you a love letter. Honestly, I can’t believe you raised Jin Ling; he’s more like me than you. Did you know that Sizhui’s actually really good at forging handwriting?”</p><p>“<em>What?!</em>”</p><p>Wei Wuxian lets go of his shoulder and winks. Then he throws open the door, startling all the servants who were listening in – the fucking traitors – grabs Jiang Cheng’s arm instead and drags him outside.</p>

    <p>As they near the Cloud Recesses, Jiang Cheng’s stomach sinks lower and lower until he thinks it might actually fall out of him. Which would be bad, since they’re currently hurtling through the air at far too many miles per hour, and Jiang Cheng simply doesn’t have the patience to search a whole forest for his internal organs.</p><p>His brother tried to make small talk at the beginning of their journey to take Jiang Cheng’s mind off things. <em>Tried</em> being the operative word. He learned about fifteen minutes in that Jiang Cheng simply wasn’t in the mood for conversation, when he summarily told his brother to shut the fuck up and just fly.</p><p>So now they’re flying in silence, the roar of the wind in Jiang Cheng’s ears the only sound he registers as they draw closer and closer to the place he’s avoided for weeks. The place where <em>he</em> is. Lan Xichen.</p><p>The knot of nerves that has begun to form in Jiang Cheng’s gut pulls tighter until he’s almost afraid he’ll never be able to untie it. It tightens more still, near to the point of breaking, when the mountain comes into view. And with it, the buildings of Cloud Recesses, low and white and familiar.</p><p>His mouth goes dry and he swallows, even as he fights to stay steady atop Sandu to keep Wei Wuxian from noticing his nervousness. He’s not sure it works, since his brother shoots him a glance anyway. Thankfully, he doesn’t say anything.</p><p>When they touch down just outside the gates of the Lan headquarters, half the Lan contingent is waiting for them. At least, that’s what it feels like.</p><p>A group of the juniors swamp them almost immediately. A few of the younger ones and some of the more excitable older ones, crowding in on them to have a look at the visitors. A very polite crowd, of course; there is next-to-no shouting, and absolutely no shoving.</p><p>“Young Master Wei, you’re back,” one of them gasps, and the rest echo the sentiment.</p><p>“No shit,” Jiang Cheng mutters under his breath. Suddenly, he has the very dubious honour of having a swarm of teenagers swivel their heads simultaneously to stare at him.</p><p>“And you brought Sect Leader Jiang!”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Off with you, come on.” Wei Wuxian waves the youngsters away with a few affectionate swats to their heads. Aside from some discreet readjusting of forehead ribbons, there is little grumbling as the kids disperse. Clearly, this is a regular occurrence.</p><p>“Sorry, they’re a bit excitable,” the older man explains to Jiang Cheng, who merely grunts in response. Frankly, he doesn’t give a shit. Just as long as none of them try to touch him.</p><p>Finally, the rubber-necking junior disciples are gone. With his vision cleared, Jiang Cheng now notices Jin Ling standing beside the gate with Lan Sizhui and Lan Jingyi, his arms crossed and back ramrod-straight. There’s an odd look on his face, as though he’s hovering between anger and concern and can’t quite pick one.</p><p>Despite the anxiety fluttering in the pit of Jiang Cheng’s stomach, he still finds it within himself to scowl. That’s <em>his</em> look, damnit. The one he reserves for when Jin Ling fucks up and gets in trouble or starts a fight he can’t win.</p><p>Jin Ling notices and scowls back harder. The fire in his eyes is unmistakeable, and Jiang Cheng’s heart thuds harder in his chest. The boy looks so much like his mother in this moment. Like Ah-Jie did on the few occasions she got really, truly angry. Hardly ever on her own behalf – only when someone insulted her family. She’d turn into a dragon then, practically, and woe betide the poor sod who thought he could talk shit about her little brothers (usually Wei Wuxian) where she could hear and get away with it.</p><p>For the second time today, Jiang Cheng’s throat threatens to close up. <em>Don’t be a sissy</em>, he tells himself firmly, but it doesn’t make it any easier to breathe. <em>Pathetic.</em></p><p>For once, he fully agrees with himself.</p><p>“Where have you been?” Jin Ling demands, stalking over to him, hands on his hips. His face is flushing red, just like it did when he was little and throwing a temper tantrum. “It’s been nearly three weeks! You haven’t sent any letters, or anything to tell us when you were coming back. No one’s heard from you the whole time you were gone, and I <em>know</em> you were bullshitting about the ‘emergency’.”</p><p>Oh, that’s Ah-Jie through and through, right down to the way she swore like a sailor when she was spitting mad. Jiang Cheng almost smiles, but then he remembers where he is. Remembers that this is Cloud Recesses, not Lotus Pier, and his own nephew is standing here attempting to scold him like he’s forgotten who raised whom.</p><p>“Don’t take that tone with me,” he warns, glaring down his nose at his nephew, who stares right back at him defiantly. “I raised you to respect your elders.”</p><p>“You also raised me to not run away from my problems,” Jin Ling fires back. Jiang Cheng nearly winces, but manages to restrain himself. The kid has a point, loathe as he is to admit it. Because that is, in fact, what he’s been doing these past weeks. Running from his problems like a gods-damned coward.</p><p>Still, he can’t do this here. Not in Cloud Recesses, tens and hundreds of miles away from home. Not surrounded by people who aren’t family, people who can hear every word and judge them for shit they don’t understand. Like Jiang Cheng’s parenting strategies.</p><p><em>Never in public</em>, his mother’s voice reminds him, sharp as steel. Just like the rest of her. She never punished him outside of Lotus Pier, just like she never argued with his father on the few occasions they attended the yearly conferences as a family.</p><p>“We’ll talk about this later,” Jiang Cheng says, hardening his expression.</p><p>Jin Ling’s eyes narrow. He looks like he’s about to retort, but suddenly, a third voice cuts through the air. Sharp and cold, like the ice that forms on the edge of roofs in winter. Frozen and deadly.</p><p>“You will talk later.” Another figure in white steps through the gate, coming face-to-face with Jiang Cheng. It’s Lan Wangji.</p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>“We will talk now,” the taller man says. His bright golden eyes bore into Jiang Cheng like he’s seeing through him. There’s nothing there of the warmth in his older brother’s eyes. Only an odd cold fire, like a blaze sealed behind a wall of ice. “Come.”</p><p>Like Jiang Cheng’s a fucking dog. Anger burns in his gut, but for some reason, he follows Lan Wangji past the gate. The others stay behind; even Wei Wuxian, which Jiang Cheng had thought was physically impossible for the two of them. Then again, his older brother had managed to separate himself from his husband for the few hours it had taken for him to barge into Lotus Pier and drag Jiang Cheng from his duties.</p><p>Yet Jiang Cheng keeps his mouth shut. He’s in the wrong here, he knows that.</p><p>Lan Wangji leads him through the Cloud Recesses’ twists and turns like he’s gliding an inch above the ground, moving sedately but at the same time fast enough that Jiang Cheng has to speed-walk to keep up, even though he’s not that much shorter. He grits his teeth against the visceral reminder of exactly why and how much he hates the second Jade of Gusu.</p><p><em>You will not make yourself look like even more of an asshole than you already are</em>, he tells himself silently. Lan Wangji doesn’t turn to look at him even once.</p><p>Eventually, they stop in front of what Jiang Cheng realises is the <em>jingshi</em>. The quarters Lan Wangji shares with his husband. Jiang Cheng has been here once before – the day before he left, in fact. Lan Xichen had led him here.</p><p>They hadn’t held hands, not like they had the day he took Jiang Cheng to the cold springs, when Lan Xichen had grabbed his hand out of anxiety and held on like it was a lifeline. But they’d walked so close that their fingers brushed, and Lan Xichen didn’t break the contact until they reached the door. This door.</p><p>Lan Wangji opens it, motions for Jiang Cheng to walk through, then enters himself and closes it behind them. He turns to face Jiang Cheng, and his face is completely blank. There’s no anger there, or sadness, or even disappointment.</p><p>Something cold runs down Jiang Cheng’s spine. Fear, most likely. There’s something about Lan Wangji that’s fucking terrifying; he’s not ashamed to admit that. Bastard is probably excellent at <em>majiang</em>.</p><p>But Jiang Cheng has never been one to run away from his fears. He had that beaten out of him at a young age, he thinks grimly, squaring his jaw and staring straight at Lan Wangji. He’s far away enough that Jiang Cheng doesn’t have to tilt his head upwards to look at him.</p><p>“You left him.”</p><p>Well, Lan Wangji goes right for the hard stuff, Jiang Cheng will give him that. He’s never been one to mince words. Neither of them are, as they’ve both found out through their numerous…clashes of opinion over the years. This, too, is familiar. A pattern, just like the one with Wei Wuxian.</p><p>It’s tempting to fall back into it. Easier, in fact, to just hurl barbs at him and watch him throw them back in fewer words that hurt all the more for how smoothly they slide under his skin. It’s what they do. Ever since Wei Wuxian died, they’ve gone for each other’s throats; Lan Wangji thinking him the one who murdered the love of his life, Jiang Cheng blaming the other man for leading his big brother astray.</p><p>But this is different. Now, it appears their situations have been reversed, and Jiang Cheng wants to laugh at the irony of it. He doesn’t.</p><p>“I did,” he says instead. Still staring straight ahead, because Lan Wangji is apparently always where the fucking chaos is and Jiang Cheng might as well try to impose some order over his emotions.</p><p>“He wrote to you. You didn’t answer. Why?” His expression is still impassive, but there’s something flickering underneath it. It looks familiar somehow, though Jiang Cheng doesn’t think he’s ever seen it on Lan Wangji.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s stomach twists painfully. He doesn’t want to answer this question. He just wants to…to go, and–</p><p>–And what?</p><p>What does he want to do?</p><p><em>I don’t know</em>, he realises. He doesn’t know why he’s here. He let Wei Wuxian drag him out here – hours and hours of flying, and he doesn’t even know why. He’s afraid, he knows that. He’d been afraid of coming. So why the fuck is he here?</p><p><em>It’s your turn to move on</em>, Wei Wuxian’s voice says in his ear. Is this how Jiang Cheng moves on? He doesn’t know that either.</p><p>Lan Wangji is still looking at him, waiting for an answer. But Jiang Cheng can’t give it. He can’t say that he was afraid, not to him. He thinks of the thirteen years the older man waited for Jiang Cheng’s brother, now legendary among the common people. They’re like the Butterfly Lovers, he’s heard some say. Not even Heaven and Earth could keep them apart forever.</p><p>Jiang Cheng isn’t sure Lan Wangji even understands what it is to fear the ones he loves. Does he know that love is conditional, that it must be earned? But then maybe he’s never had to find that out. Maybe he’s been good enough all along, and has never had to become so to earn it. Maybe he’s always deserved it.</p><p>Jiang Cheng wouldn’t know. For him, love has always been tied with fear.</p><p>Again, he thinks of Lan Xichen. Lan Xichen, with his soft smile and belief that love is a thing to be feared. <em>Love is a nightmare creature.</em></p><p>The ache in Jiang Cheng’s chest when he talks about it, because Lan Xichen is kind and good and has always deserved to love without fear.</p><p>By now, Lan Wangji seems to have sensed that he won’t be getting a reply. His eyes darken a little.</p><p>“Do you…care…for him?” The words come out one by one as though they’re being dragged out of him kicking and screaming. As though he’s choking on them.</p><p>Somehow, Jiang Cheng finds it within himself to nod. “Yes,” he says, and it’s his turn to choke on his confession.</p><p>Suddenly, Lan Wangji’s face changes. It’s as though it cracks in two, exposing something else beneath it. Something raw and furious. And yet his expression barely shifts.</p><p>It’s in his eyes, Jiang Cheng realises. And suddenly, he thinks of Lan Xichen. The brother-reader, they call him, but Jiang Cheng remembers him confessing once that Lan Wangji was as expressive as anyone else under the calm, unchanging exterior.</p><p><em>It’s easy to see</em>, he said then, soft and fond. <em>People just don’t like to look for things. They like everything presented to them, out in the open and simple to understand. Wangji isn’t like that. You have to dig to see it.</em></p><p>Jiang Cheng didn’t care at the time. Didn’t give a shit about Lan Wangji in general – thought he maybe hated him – but suddenly, he realises just how much Lan Xichen loves his brother. How important this soulless-looking man is to him. And how important he is to Lan Wangji in return.</p><p>“I do care for him,” he says again, louder this time. It’s the first time he’s ever said the words, even to himself. He’d thought they would hurt, but they don’t. Instead, it just feels like a simple declaration.</p><p>
  <em>We are not so different, after all. Perhaps that is what makes us hate each other.</em>
</p><p>“I don’t like you,” Lan Wangji says, so quietly Jiang Cheng might think he was imagining it. “You are not…kind, as my brother deserves.”</p><p>“Well, then I’m glad we agree on something.”</p><p>“But,” he continues, as though Jiang Cheng hadn’t spoken, pausing here to look as though what he’s saying physically disgusts him. “He likes you. Hurt him again, and I will kill you.”</p><p>From anyone else, it would be a threat. A promise even, or a prediction. From Hanguang-Jun, it is a statement of fact.</p><p>Jiang Cheng nods, fully expecting a continued interrogation of some sort. Instead, Lan Wangji kicks him out.</p>

    <p>Lan Huan isn’t expecting the knock on his door. A single knock, soft like the person knocking hopes that no one’s home so they can leave, then a long pause. And again, another knock just as soft nearly a minute later.</p><p>“Hello?” He calls out from where he’s currently curled up in his death-trap of a chair, untangling all his limbs from each other as he stands up.</p><p>“Open up, Zewu-Jun!” There’s a reply from behind the door, shouted loud and hurried. It’s followed by a series of rapid-fire raps on the wood, and Lan Huan sighs. Wei Wuxian again.</p><p>His brother-in-law has been visitng every day now for the past couple of weeks. Not that he’s unwelcome, mind, but these days, Lan Huan just doesn’t feel quite up to company. He should be – by the gods, Lan Huan’s been in seclusion for over a year now, he should want to talk to people so badly he’s near begging for it – but every time he hears a knock at the door, his heart stutters in his chest, expecting to hear a familiar litany of curse words in a gruff voice that’s somehow just shy of too harsh. Expecting to see blue eyes and a scowl that melts into an almost-smile when he opens the door.</p><p>But it’s never him, and the way his stomach drops when it isn’t leaves Lan Huan feeling hollow. Unable to muster the good cheer he’s famous for, and his smile always feels pasted-on.</p><p>Every time. It happens every damn time someone calls, and Lan Huan is sick of it. Is heartily sick of himself, for that matter.</p><p><em>He left</em>, he finds himself repeating both out loud and in his mind when the visitor leaves and Lan Huan is left alone again. <em>He doesn’t want you.</em></p><p>Even now, Lan Huan can barely bring himself to admit that even when no one visits him, he’s still thinking about Jiang Wanyin. He should be stronger than this. But he isn’t, and his weakness is driving him mad.</p><p>“Coming,” he answers, pulling himself out of his thoughts. He smoothes his features into a ready-made smile, ignoring how it pulls at his cheeks and makes them ache. He’s out of practice, that’s all it is.</p><p>It isn’t until he reaches the door that he registers the oddness of Wei Wuxian’s greeting. The first two knocks hadn’t sounded like him at all – too soft and hesitant, almost shy. And the demand to come in was rude even for Wei Wuxian. Despite his infamy as a troublemaker, he’s normally much more polite than that.</p><p>But he doesn’t have time to dwell on that, because he’s opening the door, peering outside to greet his brother-in-law and–</p><p>
  <em>Oh.</em>
</p><p>He really ought to have thought more about it when he’d first realised this visit was out of the ordinary. Lan Huan’s smile freezes on his face. The rest of him goes still too, and the smile cracks, suddenly brittle, and shatters into a thousand pieces.</p><p>Because Jiang Wanyin is here.</p><p>Right here, on his doorstep, eyes wide and ever-present scowl nowhere to be seen, looking like a deer in the sights of an archer that knows it’s going to be shot at. And still, somehow, the corners of his mouth tug upwards just for a moment when the door opens, the hint of a smile he can’t repress transforming his face for less than a second, as though being illuminated by a flash of lightning.</p><p>Lan Huan thinks he might be about to be sick.</p><p>“What– what’s going on here?”, he manages to get out, completely bypassing greetings and polite noises and any form of manners whatsoever. He can’t bring himself to care.</p><p>With a jolt, Lan Huan finally notices that the two of them aren’t alone. He’d forgotten for a moment, in the shock of seeing Jiang Wanyin again. Wei Wuxian reaches out from behind his brother to wave at him. A short distance away, Lan Huan notices Sizhui, Jingyi and Young Master Jin, who take Wei Wuxian’s cue and wave as well, although the young leader-to-be of the Jin sect looks rather disgruntled about it.</p><p>“Hey, Sect Leader Lan,” Wei Wuxian says cheerfully. “Sorry about the wait – I was off wrangling my wayward brother for you.”</p><p>Still dumbstruck, Lan Huan retreats back into the cottage as Wei Wuxian steps forward. His hand on the small of his brother’s back, and Jiang Wanyin has no choice but to move further into the living room with him.</p><p>Lan Huan isn’t sure it’s sunk in yet, that the other man is here. He feels rather like he’s floating, and is very carefully not looking at the other sect leader. Perhaps it’s cowardice, or the last remaining dregs of his own self-preservation, but he doesn’t know if he can bring himself to see Jiang Wanyin’s face. And if he does, whether he can stop himself from falling apart for everyone here to see.</p><p>The three cultivators stand in the middle of the living room, no one making any motion to sit. It’s Wei Wuxian who breaks the silence, of course.</p><p>“Well, now that both of you are here, I’ll leave you to it.” He grins brightly, and Lan Huan’s mouth falls open. <em>Wait, what?</em> “I’m sure you have tons to talk about.”</p><p>Before either of them can react, the ex-Yiling Patriarch crosses the room, going back the way he’d come, and darts through the door.</p><p>“Come on, kids,” he says, addressing the three teenagers standing outside the cottage. Then he turns his head back to face the two sect leaders. “Try not to kill each other, alright?”</p><p>Though he’s still smiling, there’s something in his expression that hints that he’s being serious. Without waiting for them to reply, Wei Wuxian reaches for the door and pulls it closed behind him, disappearing from view.</p><p>The door closes with a ‘thunk’, and Lan Huan is left with Jiang Wanyin. Alone. In his house.</p><p>His mind is still whirling. It’s all happening so fast – two weeks of desperately trying not to think about the man across from him and now he’s <em>here</em>, and Lan Huan has no idea what he’s going to say. There are so many things he wants to, but he has nowhere to begin, and not the slightest idea of where to end.</p><p>He looks up from where his gaze has settled on his hands, fingers laced together and clenched so his nails dig into the backs of his hands, slotting between his knuckles. All his grace seems to have deserted him. Lan Huan casts a furtive glance towards Jiang Wanyin.</p><p>Some of his hair has come out of its normally severe bun, where it’s usually tied back and pinned into submission to within an inch of its life. Now, it falls loose over his face, wild and windblown and strangely soft-looking, like he’s been flying.</p><p>Has he? The thought strikes Lan Huan suddenly. Did Jiang Wanyin fly here from Lotus Pier? An image comes to mind, of the other man the night they’d flown out to Ranwan Village. The night before he left. The memory is like a punch to the gut, knocking the wind out of Lan Huan.</p><p>The distance between them isn’t large – half the living room, perhaps, what with Wei Wuxian’s pushing – but it isn’t small either, and Lan Huan feels every inch of it keenly.</p><p>“It’s been a while,” he says finally, pushing the words past the lump in his throat when it becomes clear Jiang Wanyin isn’t going to be the one to initiate conversation. “I’d wondered how you were doing.”</p><p>There’s an awkward pause, until the younger man looks up to meet his eyes. “I’m fine,” he says. It’s off-kilter and stilted. Lan Huan can’t help but think of the easy companionship they’d shared only weeks ago, and wonder where it went.</p><p>He waits for more, but nothing comes.</p><p><em>Why</em>, he wants to ask. More than anything, he wants to ask <em>why did you leave? Why didn’t you answer any of my letters?</em></p><p>He wrote every day. Every day for nearly three weeks. His letters grew progressively longer with each one as he grew more and more agitated, and Lan Huan hated himself for it but couldn’t stop. What he’d written – he hadn’t meant to. Hadn’t meant to send the letters either, once he wrote them. He’d wanted to burn them, or bury them in the garden and let them feed the flowers, or toss them in the pond out back until the words ran and became unrecognizable. But he didn’t.</p><p>He put them in their envelopes and mailed them to Yunmeng, where they’d be delivered through countless hands by the time they reached Jiang Wanyin, who may not have even opened them.</p><p>Lan Huan wants to ask <em>why</em>, but he doesn’t. He’s not sure why that is either, but he thinks it might be because he’s afraid of the answer. It makes sense. He’s always been a coward, after all.</p><p>“Did you read them?” The question escapes without him meaning it to. Immediately, Jiang Wanyin’s eyes widen, and Lan Huan wants to clap a hand over his mouth and pretend he didn’t say anything at all. Yet his voice seems to have a mind of its own. “The letters, I mean. I– You never replied; I was afraid you weren’t getting them.”</p><p>There’s another long pause. The younger man’s hands drift together and he begins twisting Zidian around his finger.</p><p>“Yes,” he replies, and it’s not an answer until he says, “every day.”</p><p>Then he pulls the ring right off his finger and clenches it in his palm until his knuckles go white. Lan Huan’s heart lurches inside his chest and for a moment, he swears it stops beating. He doesn’t understand. He doesn’t understand anything.</p><p>“Why did you come back?” The question is sudden; it takes both of them off-guard. But Lan Huan is suddenly filled with the burning need to know. If Jiang Wanyin had run away, if he’d decided he was better off without Lan Xichen as a friend, without his constant insecurities and trust issues and everyday panics, why did he come back? Why did he read the letters, if he hadn’t bothered to reply?</p><p>Jiang Wanyin takes a step back, raises his hand and flattens his palm against the door that leads out of Lan Huan’s cottage. His whole body is tense, like he’s about to run. Like he wants to.</p><p>Then he lowers his hand again. His lips twist into a bitter smile.</p><p>“Our families,” he says ruefully, “are – I think – entirely too invested in our friendship.”</p><p>Despite himself, Lan Huan’s heart gives another lurch. <em>Friendship</em>. Does that mean–</p><p>He holds his breath instead. Begs himself not to finish that thought.</p><p>“There’s a seal on the door,” Jiang Wanyin continues. “Some sort of demonic cultivation bullshit to make sure I don’t leave again, or anything like that. We’re trapped here together for the forseeable future. <em>Wei Wuxian</em>.”</p><p>He shakes his head, but Lan Huan can tell from his tone that there’s no anger there. Or at least, none towards his brother.</p><p>“Your coming here. To Cloud Recesses.” His mouth is dry. “Was that his doing too?”</p><p>“Yes.” As Lan Huan’s stomach sinks, the other man opens his hand again to reveal his ring. Then proceeds to slide it to grip the thin band between his thumb and forefinger. In the sunlight that streams in through the window, the silver glints.</p><p>So delicate, and yet that ring has more than once ripped a living man apart. Flayed others alive. Lan Huan’s seen it happen.</p><p>“But also – I wanted to.” The other man is still talking. He ducks his head, glancing momentarily at the floor. “He didn’t…force me into coming back. Just said a few things that made me realise I needed to.”</p><p>He looks ashamed. Lan Huan’s gut twists. If he were anyone else, he would be angry, he knows. Would be furious that the other man promised to stay, to be here for him. That he offered his friendship and then disappeared for weeks, vanished like a ghost and left Lan Huan to call after him, waiting for an answer that never came.</p><p>And maybe he is angry, just a little bit, even though Lan Huan has never allowed himself to get angry. Lans aren’t supposed to. It’s on the wall of rules, carved into stone, and Lan Huan should be living his life by those rules.</p><p>But he’s been breaking them, hasn’t he? Ever since Jiang Wanyin crashed into Lan Huan’s life like a hurricane, wild and unpredictable and out-of-control, everything’s been different. It’s changed, and Lan Huan thinks that maybe he needs this. Needs this release, because it’s not right, what this is – Jiang Wanyin can’t just come into his life and upend everything. Make Lan Huan question all that he knows about himself, and then just <em>leave</em>.</p><p>Lan Huan doesn’t just need to be angry. He fucking <em>deserves </em>it.</p><p>“What <em>did</em> he say?” His stomach is in knots and on fire, and okay, maybe Lan Huan is a little more disappointed than actually mad, but he’s so tired of this. He’s been on-edge for going on three weeks now, and at this point, he feels like a wind-up toy about to snap. “What did he say that convinced you to come back, when you’d already decided you were better off away?”</p><p><em>When you’d decided that I wasn’t enough to keep you here</em>, is what he really wants to say, but he doesn’t, because that already sounds pathetic inside his head and it’ll sound even worse out loud.</p><p>Lan Huan doesn’t usually behave like this. He’s spent his whole life smiling for a reason, doing his best to radiate calm, ceaseless optimism so people look at him and think that he’s alright. A good leader for his sect, a good nephew for his uncle, a good role model for his brother. This sort of behavior isn’t like him at all.</p><p>But across from him, Jiang Wanyin doesn’t look disgusted. He just looks sad and even more ashamed, like Lan Huan’s words have actually hurt him. And he looks a little afraid, too.</p><p>“He told me the truth.” The younger man takes a deep breath and lets it out again. “He told me I was running because I was afraid, and I had to come back because I was hurting you.”</p>

    <p>Lan Huan is stunned speechless. In front of him, Jiang Wanyin is looking him straight in the face. His blue eyes are wide and shining, and honest like Lan Huan has never seen in another person. Stripped raw, like he’s completely incapable of lying.</p><p><em>I had to come back because I was hurting you</em>.</p><p>Underneath the words, there’s a layer of meaning that Lan Huan is almost too scared to pull back. <em>I came back for you</em>, it says, and Lan Huan’s breath dies in his throat.</p><p>Is it true, he wonders. Or is it simply the hopings of his own mind, seeing hidden confessions where there are none? The thought grabs hold of his heart and squeezes, and for a moment, Lan Huan feels as though he’s being pulled apart.</p><p>
  <em>I was running because I was afraid.</em>
</p><p>Jiang Wanyin’s words echo in his ears. His voice is soft. There’s something fragile in it that Lan Huan recognizes; it’s familiar – too familiar, for all that he heard it for the first time only a month ago. And despite himself, despite the anger still flickering in his stomach like a candle flame, he wants to reach out and touch the younger man. To put his hand on his shoulder like he had the morning they went to the <em>jingshi</em> to apologise, and Lan Huan had kept Jiang Wanyin from running away.</p><p>It hadn’t stuck, though. He’d been gone the next morning without even leaving a note. Perhaps it was that that had chased him away for those two weeks, kept him silent and <em>afraid</em>.</p><p>Was it Lan Huan’s fault he ran away?</p><p>The hand around his heart squeezes tighter. He hadn’t mean to, he thinks desperately. He’d tried – he’d tried <em>so hard</em> to squash those feelings down inside of him, to look at Jiang Wanyin with friendship and nothing more, to give him what he needed instead of taking what Lan Huan wanted. But it had slipped out; that need to touch, to ground and anchor him, and maybe that had crossed a line.</p><p>Maybe it was his fault after all.</p><p>But Jiang Wanyin is still speaking.</p><p>“I didn’t want to hurt you,” he says. That fragility is still there, and Lan Huan’s heart gutters like a dying candle flame. “I’m tired of hurting people.”</p><p>Finally, Lan Huan can’t help it any longer. The question he’s been waiting to ask for weeks bursts out of him. “Then why did you leave in the first place? You should have known – you must have. What would happen.”</p><p>Zidian has begun to pulse with violet light. No crackles yet – the other man isn’t angry, but his spiritual weapon is attuned to its owner’s emotions. Jiang Wanyin looks agitated now.</p><p>“Because Wei Wuxian was right!” It comes out in a rush, like he’s trying to say it all at once to spare himself the shame. “I was afraid. And I didn’t want to – <em>couldn’t</em> – deal with it, so I left. Went back to Lotus Pier and sealed myself off from the world for a while.”</p><p>“You of all people should know what that’s like.”</p><p>All of a sudden, the room goes quiet. Jiang Wanyin’s mouth seals shut, and a look of shock takes over his face. He hadn’t mean to say that, Lan Huan knows even as his stomach plummets and all the anger rushes out of him.</p><p>It leaves like water from a hole poked in a waterskin, leaving his skin feeling too loose and his insides hollow.</p><p>For a moment, he thinks about sucking in a breath and trying to call the fury back to him. Shoring up the dying flame and spitting harsh words right back to hit the other man in the soft parts of him where he’s vulnerable and hurting. The parts Lan Huan knows exists because Jiang Wanyin himself showed them to him.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” the younger sect leader says. His voice has dropped a register. It’s hardly above a whisper. “That was out of line.”</p><p>And then Lan Huan remembers the thing about anger. It’s been so long since anyone reminded him that he’s almost forgotten it, but now the words his uncle taught him as a child that he in turn passed to Wangji come back to him.</p><p><em>Anger is a poison</em>, Shu-Fu says in his memory, stern and unsmiling and the closest thing Lan Huan has known to a father since he was nine years old. <em>It enters your body and your blood, and does not leave until it has run its course. And even then, it is hard to expel. It pollutes your mind too – focuses it on a single goal of destruction. It is useful in a fight or a battle, but it will hurt you later if you cannot let it go.</em></p><p>Lan Huan doesn’t want this to be a battle. He’s done enough fighting for a lifetime.</p><p><em>Aren’t you tired, Wanyin?</em> He wants to ask, barely even registering the familiar way his subconscious addresses the other man. It doesn’t matter at this point. <em>You’re always angry, I know. For you, everything is a fight, and you stay angry because you think it will help you win.</em></p><p>
  <em>Don’t you ever want to let go?</em>
</p><p>But, like with all the other questions that have crossed his mind since he first saw Jiang Wanyin outside his door, Lan Huan swallows it. Lets the truth sink down into his stomach where it can’t get out.</p><p>But instead of settling there in the dark, it keeps sinking. All the way down, until it cracks him right open and something else crawls out into the light.</p><p>He sounds hoarse when he begins to speak again, as though he hasn’t used it for weeks.</p><p>“After…what happened at the Guanyin Temple, I went into seclusion because I couldn’t face the thought that I had been living a lie. For nearly twenty years, Jin Guangyao was my brother, and for nearly all of those, he had been a murderer.”</p><p>Lan Huan’s voice cracks on the last word. He hasn’t said that name in so long. For over a year now, it’s just been <em>he</em>, as though there would only ever be one. One man that truly mattered.</p><p>“You can’t– you can’t imagine what that was like.”</p><p>“I can.” Jiang Wanyin doesn’t move, but his gaze holds Lan Huan’s. Zidian has stopped pulsing, and now the only light in the room is the sunlight coming through the windows.</p><p>Lan Huan’s lips twitch upwards.</p><p>“You can,” he acknowledges. That had been a foolish thing to say. “I thought that he had ruined me, or that I had already been broken. There had to have been something wrong with me, that I could not see his betrayal.”</p><p>“There wasn’t.”</p><p>The younger man says it immediately. Earnestly, completely without hesitation. Somehow, Lan Huan feels the urge to smile. <em>I don’t need comforting</em>, he imagines saying. <em>I’m trying to make a point.</em></p><p>For the first time, mentioning <em>him</em> doesn’t feel like being stabbed. There’s an ache in his chest when Lan Huan’s mind conjures up the image of him, small and slender and always smiling like he knew a secret the rest of the world did not, but Lan Huan knows enough about himself by now to know that that ache will never go away.</p><p>This is the best it will ever be. He knows that now. It hurts – as Jiang Wanyin might say, it hurts like a bitch – but it hurts so much less than it did a year ago. Or even a month ago.</p><p>Lan Huan continues, almost ignoring the younger man’s quick reassurance but for the fond look he can’t stop from rising to his face. There’s only so much pining and paperwork anyone can do in two weeks – in the rest of that time, Lan Huan has been doing a lot of thinking. About his past, what he’s done.</p><p>He needs to say this. He has to.</p><p>“I let him use me, you see. I sheltered him while he tore apart our family, and I loved him while he did it. I thought– I thought I knew him, that he was the person he showed to me. Kind, gentle, misunderstood. Perhaps he was, but I never knew all of him. I never let myself believe what he was truly capable of.”</p><p>Yet in the last few weeks, Lan Huan has forced himself to confront the truth of it. Jin Guangyao killed his father. His innocent, devoted wife. His five-year-old son. <em>Their</em> righteous brother. The list went on still longer.</p><p>Lianfang-Zun had worked his way through half <strike>his</strike> their family by the end of it, and Lan Huan had been blind to everything. He’d been just as guilty as his sworn brother.</p><p>“After everything, I thought that by locking myself away in this cottage, I could atone for my sins. I thought I deserved it. A…punishment, of sorts, for standing by and doing nothing.”</p><p>“But it was also a hiding place.” The admission costs Lan Huan something. A sharp pain in his ribs like a sword being pulled out, the hurt white-hot but strangely a relief. “I saw betrayal everywhere. I couldn’t trust anyone, not after that. So I made it so I wouldn’t have to.”</p><p>Lan Huan is well aware that he’s talking too much. But the words are pouring out of him, and he can’t stop them. To be honest, he doesn’t want to. Across from him, Jiang Wanyin hasn’t said a word. Is just standing there, blue eyes oddly dark, looking as though he wants to look away but can’t bring himself to.</p><p>“Do you understand? Everything that I did – all of it – had to do with fear. The hiding away, running from my responsibilities. But it didn’t protect me. All it did was hurt. My brother, my uncle, my sect; even myself.”</p><p>The irony is bitter in his mouth. He smiles with all his teeth. It’s ugly, but for a moment, he catches Jiang Wanyin’s gaze darting down to his mouth before it returns to look him in the eyes again. He takes a step forward, watching the surprise flit over the younger man’s face.</p><p>Lan Huan almost expects him to step back and maintain the distance between them, but Jiang Wanyin holds his ground.</p><p>“How did you–” He speaks in a whisper, voice hushed and something like awed, trailing off. But even now, Lan Huan understands.</p><p>“It started when we went to the cold springs,” he answers the unfinished question. “When you asked me where I wanted to go.”</p><p>The other sect leader’s mouth falls open, and Lan Huan feels the sharp edges of the smile on his face soften. He risks another step forward, then another, until they’re less than an arm’s length apart. Lan Huan could reach out and touch him, if he wanted. And Jiang Wanyin could do the same.</p><p>The thought makes something in Lan Huan’s chest hammer hard against his ribs. It might be his heart.</p><p>“Your fear hurt me,” he says finally. Stronger now, and louder. His voice fills up the rest of the room, nearly too loud now that the two of them are so close together. “Is hurting me. It’s also hurting your brother and your nephew. But most of all, it’s hurting you.”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin has begun to shake. Only a little, but Lan Huan can spot when the trembling starts. His eyes are reddening, just enough to tell. He says nothing.</p><p>“What are you afraid of?”, Lan Huan asks.</p><p>He remembers the day he’d talked about, when Lan Huan brought the younger man to the cold springs. How he’d fallen apart in the water, hissing and spitting and lashing Zidian out in a blind rage, and ended up on the grass trying to vomit the memories out.</p><p>How his hands shook even as he showed Lan Huan the scars on his chest, baring all the shame he felt and didn’t deserve.</p><p>
  <em>He made me know what it’s like to have nothing, to be nothing, and I haven’t been able to forget that.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I’m always afraid.</em>
</p><p>In the present, Jiang Wanyin shakes his head. “It doesn’t matter,” he says. It’s an echo of that day at the cold springs. The same thing he’d said the first time Lan Huan had asked about his scars.</p><p>Lan Huan wonders if he’s thinking of it too, or if it’s just a coincidence. But even if it is, he gives the same reply he did then. “Please,” he whispers. “I want to understand.”</p><p>The other man just shakes his head again. “I’m sorry. For hurting you. For running away and not keeping my promise. For abandoning you when I said you could trust me.”</p><p>The words wrench at Lan Huan’s heart. Jiang Wanyin looks so sad. And so young too, so much smaller than the intimidating six feet he stands at.</p><p>“It’s all right.”</p><p>
  <em>I know you didn’t want to. You, of all people, have never lied to me. It’s all right to be afraid; I do trust you.</em>
</p><p>“Please,” he continues. “Help me understand. Why are you afraid?”</p><p>Lan Huan can see the exact moment Jiang Wanyin decides to answer him. Something behind his eyes breaks; shatters into tiny pieces. Suddenly, Lan Huan is a little bit afraid of whatever it is that the other man wants to tell him.</p><p>Because he knows, without a doubt, that whatever Jiang Wanyin says next will change everything. The friendship between them, the trust they’ve achieved –close to sworn brotherhood, but not quite – could snap, or be rebuilt whole and new and something else entirely. And though Lan Huan’s just made an epic, rousing speech about leaving fear behind, he feels an entirely new kind of afraid.</p><p><em>Please</em>. He doesn’t know what he’s praying for. Maybe a miracle. All he knows is that he needs it like he needs air, and if this all comes crashing down he might not know how to fix it. <em>Please.</em></p><p>Jiang Wanyin looks him in the eye and says, “because I love you.” And because he’s Jiang Wanyin, he adds, “you fucking idiot."</p>

    <p>The world goes still with Jiang Cheng’s admission. The weight of it, so heavy on his tongue, dissipates into the air and settles over the two of them. All of a sudden, Jiang Cheng feels like he’s been sent careening down a mountain, trying desperately to slow down and wondering if he’ll manage to stop before he reaches the cliff’s edge.</p><p>Lan Xichen’s eyes widen as he takes a shocked breath. The dark gold of them is as warm as ever, but somehow piercing, stripping Jiang Cheng down to the bone until he feels naked, completely bare under the layers and layers of sect leader robes he wears. This is the second-most terrified he’s ever been in his life.</p><p>Dimly, he registers that he’s never said <em>I love you</em> before.</p><p>Not out loud, at least. Not even to his sister, or his brother, or his parents. Not even to Jin Ling. It’s always remained an unspoken truth, because Jiang Cheng doesn’t do this – doesn’t admit to love or affection, not ever. The confession feels torn out of him, buried deep until it had sunk its roots into the very core of him and then cruelly ripped out, leaving torn flesh and weeping blood in its wake.</p><p>It hurts. It fucking <em>hurts</em>.</p><p>Opposite him, close enough to reach out and touch, Lan Xichen says nothing. His eyes are still wide, his hands still by his sides, not even moving. He’s clearly reeling, and equally unsure of how to respond.</p><p>And that, in itself, is as much of a response as Jiang Cheng needs. The air leaves his lungs, suddenly punched out of him. His hands curl into fists by his sides, nails digging into his palms so hard he thinks they might draw blood, though he cut them only a couple days ago.</p><p><em>This is it, then</em>, he thinks wildly, the thought tinged with a faint edge of hysteria. Or perhaps mania. His whole soul is bared here, now that he’s said those words, and the person he’s shown it to has once again decided that they don’t want it. Not that he can fucking blame them.</p><p><em>You asked</em>. The thought comes, unwanted, and there’s that petulant desperation that Jiang Cheng hates but can’t get rid of. <em>You asked for the truth and I gave it to you. Isn’t this what you wanted?</em></p><p>“I’m sorry,” he says instead. “I’m sorry if this isn’t what you wanted to hear.”</p><p>He turns to leave, uncaring if he has to break Wei Wuxian’s stupid demonic cultivation barrier himself to get the fuck out of this house, or maybe just leave to another room where Lan Xichen doesn’t have to look at him anymore. He knows he’s fucked up. Crossed so many lines he can’t even see the way back to the path anymore, because they were supposed to be <em>friends</em> and then he went and fell in love and then went and ran away, and Jiang Cheng has never been able to do anything right but this has been the one thing he didn’t want to screw up. Because if anything, Lan Xichen deserves to be happy, after all his heartbreak.</p><p>What he said just now, about Jin Guangyao… Jiang Cheng had heard the pain in it, and it had torn at his heart. The truth of it, and how fucking brave Lan Xichen had been to say it all out loud, to look the past in the eye and decide to move on.</p><p>Jiang Cheng has only ever been stuck in the past. Though he’s grown up, gotten taller and stronger, on the inside, he still feels like the same person he was when he was seventeen. In pain and always angry, and too scared to move past it because the rage was all he had. Even now, with the anger slowly being washed away, the fear remains.</p><p>Lan Xichen deserves better.</p><p>But just as Jiang Cheng takes a step back towards the door, a hand shoots out and grabs his wrist, holding him in place.</p><p>“No,” a voice says. It takes him a moment to register that it’s Lan Xichen’s, soft and gentle as ever even though the steel in it takes him by surprise. Jiang Cheng freezes. “You don’t get to run away again.”</p><p>The hand is gentle, too, as it tugs him back to face Lan Xichen again – his fingers are long and go all the way around Jiang Cheng’s wrist with room to spare – and the other man is smiling.</p><p>“I thought–”</p><p>“You didn’t wait,” Lan Xichen interrupts. His eyes are red, but Jiang Cheng searches his expression for any trace of disgust and finds none. “You didn’t ask how I felt. If it was the same.”</p><p>All thought flies from Jiang Cheng’s mind, leaving it blank. There’s no room for words in his head anymore, only emotions, and for a moment, a spark of something flickers in his stomach. It’s not hope. It can’t be.</p><p><em>Please</em>, he thinks. Not the word, only the feeling that he’s begging, that he desperately needs something from Lan Xichen, although he doesn’t quite know what it is he’s begging for. <em>Please</em>.</p><p>He doesn’t know either that he’s been saying his thoughts aloud until the smile fades from the older man’s face, to be replaced by an expression that looks as desperate as Jiang Cheng feels. His hand disappears from around Jiang Cheng’s wrist, and Jiang Cheng can’t help but mourn the loss of it. The warmth, the reassurance of being connected to another person.</p><p>But then Lan Xichen does something strange and unexpected. He raises his hand to Jiang Cheng’s face. Presses it against his skin, molding his fingers to Jiang Cheng’s cheekbone, his palm curving to fit Jiang Cheng’s jaw. The warmth returns, doubled this time.</p><p>“I told you once that people in my family love once in our whole lives.” The other man speaks softly, but this close, Jiang Cheng hears every word. Lan Xichen’s eyes are slightly above his and so he has to look up, but it doesn’t feel like the other sect leader is looking down on him. It never has, with Lan Xichen.</p><p>“As children, we were always told that love would lead to happiness. I took that to mean that I could only be happy if I loved first. My brother, my family, my sect. My future spouse, whoever they would be.” There’s something in his face now, and Jiang Cheng realises that this is an old hurt, buried so deep it’s never seen the sun. “But with my father…and then Wangji, I realised that love didn’t guarantee happiness. I stopped believing in it, stopped wanting it.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s heart aches at the pain in the other man’s voice. He opens his mouth to say something, to reassure him, but Lan Xichen just shakes his head.</p><p>“I was wrong,” he says. Jiang Cheng’s mouth falls closed again. “I had it backwards the whole time.”</p><p>The sadness doesn’t disappear from his face, but a smile spreads over it. Like the sun emerging from the clouds after a long rain.</p><p>“I’ve realised now that happiness doesn’t come from love. It’s that…when someone makes you happy – when you feel better with them around – that’s how you know you love them.”</p><p>Lan Xichen closes his eyes then and sighs, a puff of air leaving his mouth, and when he opens them again to look at Jiang Cheng, he doesn’t feel afraid anymore. The perpetual anger, the whispering voices in his head that never shut up, have finally quieted.</p><p>“You– you made me happy even before I was in love with you,” he says. Suddenly, it’s like a wave crests over Jiang Cheng’s heart, the tidal pull of something inside him, strong and inexorable. He thinks it’s been there for a while now, and he’s just been fighting it. He doesn’t want to fight anymore; he’s tired.</p><p>But it doesn’t feel right to him, just giving in. It’s too good – Lan Xichen’s admission that he loves Jiang Cheng too – even though Jiang Cheng desperately wants to believe it’s true, how could it be?</p><p>The other man’s words ring in his mind. <em>We love once in our whole lives</em>. He thinks of his brother, Lan Wangji’s one and only. How brilliant Wei Wuxian is, how brightly he shines, with everything he’s done. It’s what he deserves, really, to be the priority of someone like Hanguang-Jun.</p><p>Jiang Cheng’s never been anyone’s ‘one and only’. He’s not built for it, doesn’t shine like someone who deserves it.</p><p>His mother did, he thinks, but then as much as everyone’s always said Jiang Cheng was like her, he’s never quite managed to live up to what his mother was, and Yu Ziyuan hadn’t been anyone’s ‘one and only’ either.</p><p>“But how can you be in love with me?”, Jiang Cheng asks, the breath in his lungs wound up tight, if that’s even possible. It feels possible. “How can I be in love with you? I don’t understand it. I’ve been in Lotus Pier for more than two weeks – that’s longer than the time I spent here with you, seeing you every day. But this whole time, I couldn’t stop thinking about you. You were all I thought about. Tell me, how can that be?”</p><p>“How does anyone fall in love?”, Lan Xichen returns. “If it helps, we’ve known each other for nearly twenty years. Perhaps we’ve always been building towards this.”</p><p>Jiang Cheng can feel his hands begin to tremble. He wants to believe him so badly. He does.</p><p>“Please just tell me if this is real. I can’t do this if it isn’t. If I’m just some fucking rebound so you can forget about the people who broke your heart.” And it’s true. Jiang Cheng can’t take it if this is just like every other time that came before it. He’d rather be nothing at all than someone’s last resort. Not again. He can’t do this again.</p><p>The words have to sting. He knows they do – Jiang Cheng has always been cruel, and how can an accusation like that not hurt? – but Lan Xichen doesn’t let go of him. He doesn’t even flinch.</p><p>“You’re not. And this is real, all of it.” He gestures with the hand that isn’t on Jiang Cheng’s face, his eyes bright and suspiciously shiny.</p><p>“I used to worry about my brother all the time,” he says. The abrupt shift in topic catches Jiang Cheng off-guard, but he keeps quiet. It’s obvious that Lan Xichen is going somewhere with this. “Even after he got married, after he got strong and powerful and happy, I worried. But I don’t anymore. Because I met you. And you make me feel like everything will be all right.”</p><p>The tightness in Jiang Cheng’s chest eases, rushes out of him until he feels loose-limbed and nearly dizzy with it, until it feels like the only thing keeping him upright is Lan Xichen’s hand on the side of his face. Tethering him to the world.</p><p>“I’m sorry for everything,” he says again. He’s said that phrase so much in the past five minutes, but his time, there’s another layer of meaning to it.</p><p>It’s then that Lan Xichen’s hand on Jiang Cheng’s cheek turns into him gripping the back of his neck. He pulls him forward and then suddenly they’re kissing, mouths pressed together and breathing each other’s air and it’s like nothing Jiang Cheng’s ever felt before. It’s <em>warm</em>.</p><p>When they pull apart, they stay touching, their foreheads resting together. Both of them are breathing hard, and Jiang Cheng’s heart is pounding like he’s just run a mile, but warmth is buzzing through his veins and he feels like he could run another hundred off this feeling alone.</p><p>It has to be a little uncomfortable for Lan Xichen, with his head bent at this awkward angle to make up for the couple of inches’ difference between them, but he shows no sign of it. His mouth curls into a smile, same as ever, but this one is different. Softer and warmer, and it shines with a naked happiness that makes Jiang Cheng feel like he’s staring into the fucking sun.</p><p>“I was half a person when I found you,” he whispers. The truth in it doesn’t even scare him.</p><p>“Well, then, it’s a good thing I was afraid of people.”</p><p>When they kiss again, Jiang Cheng can feel Lan Xichen’s smile against his lips. It’s bright still, and for the first time in a long while, Jiang Cheng lets himself dare to hope that he can have this. That they can be happy, the both of them, and that maybe they’ve learned to move on.</p>

    <p>It’s not the sun, nor his family’s famously reliable body clock that wakes Lan Huan the next morning. Instead, it’s the feeling of fingers trailing over his arm, callouses imperceptible through the thin cloth of his inner robes, that rouses him from sleep. The movement is foreign and gentle, almost curious, like a timid foal nosing at an outstretched hand holding an apple.</p><p>Whatever time it is now, it’s definitely not five o’ clock.</p><p>As Lan Huan’s brain stirs slowly to wakefulness, he becomes aware of the warm feeling of sunlight on his face. It’s like something out of a dream. He keeps his eyes shut, not wanting to ruin the moment. The illusion, probably, as Lan Huan has woken alone and lonely in his bed for the past gods-know-how-long.</p><p>But a second passes, then a minute, and the scene doesn’t shatter. And then the memories begin to unspool from Lan Huan’s mind, playing behind his eyes. The previous day comes back to him: Jiang Wanyin’s return, their argument, the making-up, and everything after.</p><p>He very nearly doesn’t catch the gasp that wants to escape him at the revelation, but he manages it with an effort, fighting to keep his breathing deep and even too, like he’s still asleep. Because as he does so, as his body and mind shrug off the fog of sleep, Lan Huan becomes aware of another thing that is different about this morning. A sound.</p><p>A hum, really, coming from the man next to him, on his side with his front pressed to Lan Huan’s shoulder and an arm lying across his chest. The weight of it on his ribs makes Lan Huan dizzy.</p><p>The sound is like a thrum, the vibrations starting from inside him and travelling to Lan Huan’s arm, then spreading all the way up to his head and all the way down to his toes. It’s soft, wordless; the melody is one Lan Huan doesn’t recognise. But even early as it is, his throat undoubtedly hoarse from sleep, Jiang Wanyin’s voice is beautiful. Like the rest of him.</p><p>Lan Huan turns over onto his side to face the other man. The humming stops, and the arm Jiang Wanyin lay over him retracts as if burned. He flushes red, and Lan Huan mourns the loss of his warmth.</p><p>“I didn’t know you were awake,” he says, embarrassed, looking down even though he’s horizontal and that technically means he’s looking sideways. The thought brings a smile to Lan Huan’s face.</p><p>“Only just. What was that? The song.”</p><p>The flush in the younger man’s cheeks brightens. It makes him look younger; vulnerable, almost. Lan Huan wants to touch it, briefly, and then realises that he can, now. He does.</p><p>Jiang Wanyin doesn’t shy away from the touch. Rather, he leans into it unconsciously. “It’s nothing,” he says, but the blush doesn’t fade.</p><p>“Didn’t sound like nothing. It was…nice.”</p><p><em>Nice</em>. Lan Huan chastises himself for the poor word choice. But it had been either that or <em>wonderful-amazing-beautiful</em>, and Lan Huan saw enough last night to know that Jiang Wanyin is still relatively new to affection. To the praise he deserves and hasn’t received often enough. But there will be time for that later.</p><p>It will be better to go slowly, for now.</p><p>Still, the meager compliment seems to have flustered him enough that the other man actually opens his mouth.</p><p>“It’s a…lullaby, from Yunmeng. One of the old ones,” he admits. “<em>Ah-Niang</em> used to sing it to us, when we were very small. After Jin Ling was born, <em>Ah-Jie</em> sang it to him too.”</p><p>“And you kept it up through his childhood,” Lan Huan guesses, smiling wider at how Jiang Wanyin shifts when the guess strikes home. He is soft inside, despite the hard exterior. Lan Huan had known that already, of course, but something about the reminder makes his chest feel warm.</p><p>“You have a lovely voice,” he continues, when no reply is forthcoming. The younger man buries his face in the pillow, though Lan Huan knows his ears are still exposed behind the ridiculous curtain of hair that falls and obscures the rest of his features. He reaches out to tangle his fingers in the soft, loose curls, and doesn’t let go when Jiang Wanyin swats at his hand ineffectually. “Would you sing for me one day? So I can hear you properly?”</p><p>Jiang Wanyin turns his head again to look up at him. “Why would you want that?”</p><p>From anyone else, it would be fishing for compliments. A ploy for the admission of the obvious skill the other man possesses. But Jiang Wanyin’s eyes are wide and guileless, genuinely questioning, and Lan Huan realises that the sweet ache that swells in his heart is something that he’s going to have to get used to. He stretches out his thumb to brush over the bones of Jiang Wanyin’s cheeks. The high arches, sharp under the skin.</p><p>“Because you’re good,” he says honestly. He’s not just talking about the singing.</p><p>
  <em>Because I’ve never heard you before, not like that. I’m not sure you let anyone hear it either. And I’m glad – I’m so, so glad – that you trust me with it.</em>
</p><p>It’s a gift, it really is.</p><p>Lan Huan gets a shy smile in return. “One day, then.” The agreement comes after a moment’s hesitation.</p><p>It’s another few minutes before either of them move. They lie there, quiet, not quite touching skin-to-skin but able to feel the heat of each other through their robes. The only noise in Lan Huan’s tiny bedroom is the sound of their breathing, and Lan Huan wonders when he managed to amass enough luck in his short, sorry life to be able to have this, even just for a morning. Then he remembers about Jiang Wanyin’s shorter, even sorrier life, and thinks that it must have been a joint effort.</p><p>A sharp snort comes from the person next to him, startling Lan Huan out of his very pleasant daze. He must have been thinking out loud.</p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” says Jiang Wanyin. It’s more affectionate than derogatory, but the hint of abrasiveness is still there. Still rough, despite his smoothened edges. Lan Huan loves him all the more for it.</p><p>The other man kicks him under the covers and stands up, extracting himself from the bed as he does so. Lan Huan follows suit, wincing at the sudden soreness in his leg, although Jiang Wanyin hadn’t kicked him that hard.</p><p>They dress separately, pulling their own robes on. Lan Huan’s are folded neatly on the nightstand; he shakes them to get the creases out. Jiang Wanyin’s clothes, by contrast, are draped over the back of a chair, which is more efficient if slightly messier.</p><p>He wrinkles his nose at them as he puts them on. “I can’t believe this is the third time I’m doing the gods-damned walk of shame from your house,” he grumbles. “This is embarrassing.”</p><p>Lan Huan laughs softly to himself, acknowledging the irony in their current situation. Despite the rather…compromising position they woke up in this morning, little had happened last night.</p><p>To be honest, they’d spent most of it talking. Between awkward pauses, neither of them really knowing what to say, they’d both agreed on moving slowly. Taking things one step at a time, not wanting to go too fast and send everything crashing into a wall. Their relationship – whatever it is – is still too delicate for that. Fragile, like a new-made teacup that neither of them wants to see shatter. They have too much experience with that to handle it carelessly.</p><p>Lan Huan isn’t his brother, and Jiang Wanyin isn’t his. They both have responsibilities. Burdens to bear, only some of them official. It’s the others – the scars and the memories – that cause them to tread cautiously here, for fear of breaking this new thing that is growing between them.</p><p>It’s better to go slowly for now, Lan Huan thinks again, his thoughts echoing those of a few minutes ago.</p><p>“If it helps,” he says finally, looking up to give Jiang Wanyin a cheeky half-smile, “you could always borrow my clothes again.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“I have a few extra sets lying around, and we already know they fit you.”</p><p>“Fuck off,” Jiang Wanyin shoots back, but he’s smiling now too. “I think I’ll take my chances with my own clothes, thanks.”</p><p>Lan Huan has to bite down on his lip to keep himself from grinning like an idiot. The warmth in his chest only intensifies. He ties his outermost robe closed and secures the belt over it. The other man does the same, but somehow Lan Huan feels as though something’s missing. He scans the room for whatever it is, and finally spots his forehead ribbon, lying curled up on itself on the nightstand.</p><p>He picks it up, about to thread it through his own hair, when all of a sudden, a jolt runs through him. Jiang Wanyin is watching him, blue eyes large and dark in his face. The ribbon abruptly feels heavy in his hand. Weighted.</p><p>He’s never put it on in front of someone else before. Has never even taken it off with someone else in the room, the way he did last night. His forehead ribbon isn’t an article of clothing – it barely even covers any skin – but somehow, without it, he suddenly feels more naked than he would if he were stripped bare.</p><p>His throat is very dry. Lan Huan swallows, and feels the walls of it nearly stick together.</p><p>“Are you going to wear that, or just stare at it?”</p><p>The other man’s voice breaks Lan Huan’s reverie. His head snaps up to look at Jiang Wanyin, momentarily feeling caught out.</p><p>“I– I–” he stammers. The cloth is burning a hole in his palm. The words tumble out before he can choke them back. “Would you?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Surprise flits across Jiang Wanyin’s face, matching the shock that fills Lan Huan at what he’s just said. He can’t have, can he? Not like this, after barely a night together. He’s supposed to have more self-control than this.</p><p>But when Lan Huan searches his own emotions, he can find no trace of regret in among the shock at his own forwardness. The other man must know what it means; Yunmeng is one of his sect’s closest allies. He’s far from ignorant of the Lan clan’s traditions, especially one as important as this.</p><p>He has to know what Lan Huan is saying here, even if he himself hadn’t known what he was going to say before it came flying out of his mouth. Lan Huan’s forehead ribbon is everything. It’s his discipline, his self-control, everything that makes him a good cultivator and maybe a decent human being. No one’s supposed to touch it. No one gets to, except his fated person.</p><p>Asking Jiang Wanyin this is worse (better?) than carving his own ribs open to bare his heart. Than telling him he loves him.</p><p>Asking Jiang Wanyin this is saying <em>you are my everything. My forever.</em> Because Lans don’t do anything less than forever, and Lan Huan realised weeks ago that he would give everything for this angry, ridiculous, emotionally constipated man.</p><p>“Really,” he says, the strength of the conviction in his voice taking them both aback. “Wanyin, would you do this for me?”</p><p><em>Take it</em>, is unspoken. <em>Take my everything, all that I am offering to you. Please. Let all I have to give be enough.</em></p><p>There’s something in Jiang Wanyin’s face now. Something open and vulnerable and completely terrifying. Slowly, he reaches out his hand. But before his fingers close around it, he pauses. Looks Lan Huan directly in the face.</p><p>“Could you say that again?”</p><p>Lan Huan’s brow furrows. “Would you do this for me?”</p><p>“No.” A flush rises to the other man’s cheeks once more. “I meant…my name. Could you say it again?”</p><p>“Wanyin,” Lan Huan says, voice suddenly near a whisper. “You have a beautiful name.”</p><p>“I like when you say it,” Jiang Wanyin – no, just <em>Wanyin</em>, it seems – confesses, face pink. “No one’s ever called me that before. Just that, without my <em>xing</em>.”</p><p>Inside his chest, Lan Huan’s heart grows three sizes. Impulsively, he says it again. And when the other man’s blush intensifies, he says, “You can call me by my name, if you want. I think…I think I’d like you to.”</p><p>“Lan Huan.”</p><p>The name rolls off Wanyin’s tongue like it was made to. Like this, <em>Lan Huan</em> sounds like a whole person, when before only <em>Lan Xichen</em> felt real outside of his own head. Two characters instead of three, and it’s the first time Lan Huan’s ever felt like it really belonged to him. A true name instead of the placeholder it had been until he turned fifteen and the only person who kept using it was Lan Huan, who couldn’t bear to let go of the first thing his mother had given him.</p><p>Before he knows it, they’re kissing. Lan Huan’s hand is on Wanyin’s hair, on his neck, and Wanyin’s hand enters his other one, takes hold of the smooth white cloth and doesn’t let go.</p><p>When they pull apart, Wanyin guides him to the edge of the just-made bed. Lan Huan sits down, and the other man slides in behind him, bracketing Lan Huan’s body with his knees.</p><p>“Let me,” he says, and takes hold of Lan Huan’s hair. Lan Huan lets him. His fingers are strong but gentle, carding through the strands with the ease of long practice.</p><p>It feels momentous, this thing that Lan Huan is letting him do, and yet somehow it also feels like the most ordinary thing in the world.</p><p>“I need to tell you something.” This, like everything else Lan Huan has said today, comes out without him thinking about it. At this point, he’s ceased to be shocked. It’s past time he accepted that something about Wanyin makes him more truthful than he intends. Makes him say things he means, almost before he thinks them. Around Wanyin, his self-control isn’t what he thought it was. And that might not be an entirely bad thing.</p><p>“What?” The fingers are still carding through his hair, gathering the strands into what feels like a thin tail.</p><p>“I canceled my matchmaking application.”</p><p>“When?” The other man’s voice doesn’t change. He doesn’t seem all that surprised. Or perhaps he’s like Lan Huan in this regard, in that this thing between them has made both of them begin to accept the unexpected as a fact of life.</p><p>“Right after you left,” Lan Huan confesses ruefully, feeling just a bit pathetic. “I realised I couldn’t be…<em>with</em> anyone else. It wouldn’t have worked. Wouldn’t have been fair to them, either. And whoever it would’ve been deserved better than that.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“You’ve said that,” Lan Huan counters. Despite himself, a smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. “It is your fault, you know. You’ve ruined me for anyone else.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Wanyin says again. The regret in his voice is real, and Lan Huan swivels his head back around to kiss him, disregarding how it jostles the younger man’s fingers from their places in his hair.</p><p>“Don’t be. It never could have been anyone but you, anyway. And besides, it was something I needed to do, like coming out of seclusion. I needed to realise no one else could fix my problems; I have to do that myself.”</p><p>“I’d never ask you to do something like that for me. You know that, right?”</p><p>Lan Huan laughs. It still feels like a novelty, to be able to laugh freely, without constantly worrying if he deserves to.</p><p>“I know,” he replies. “I did it for me.”</p>

    <p>“I have to tell you something too,” Wanyin says when they’re done and the ribbon is secured around Lan Huan’s forehead. There aren’t any mirrors in the cottage – it’s a family belief that spending too long looking at one’s reflection is a sign of vanity – and so Wanyin was the one to guide Lan Huan’s fingers to the back of his head to feel what he’d done there.</p><p>Lan Huan’s forehead ribbon is tied neatly around his head, as it should be. But the ends of it that he usually keeps free and loose are now braided into his hair, trailing all the way down his back before ending off at a tie that Wanyin has seemingly produced from thin air.</p><p>It’s…different. Lan Huan thinks he likes it this way.</p><p>“What?”, he asks, touching the end of his braid to feel the tuft of hair right before it cuts off. He feels good right now, loose and relaxed, like he’s ready for almost anything.</p><p>“I was… thinking. While I was away. Back at Lotus Pier.”</p><p>“What about?”</p><p>But Wanyin doesn’t give him a direct answer. Instead, he comes around to Lan Huan’s front, where Lan Huan can see him without craning his neck.</p><p>“Where do you see this going?”, he asks. The muscles in his shoulders, leading up to his neck, go tense, but he doesn’t frown or scowl or do any of the other myriad things he does when he’s anxious. “Us. In the future.”</p><p>Instantly, Lan Huan knows what he means. The two of them, both men, both sect leaders. Neither of them can produce an heir, nor can one of them <em>move in</em> with the other, give up his family name and let his identity be subsumed into the other’s sect. They both have responsibilities – there’s that word again – to their clans. To their families, and to themselves.</p><p>Not for the first time, Lan Huan feels the prick of envy for what his brother has, though he quickly squashes it. He is glad, he reminds himself, that Wangji is free on the wind. That he doesn’t have to subject himself to the constraints of expectations, the ties of duty that bind Lan Huan to the place he was born in. The place he will die in, too, if his Council has anything to say about it.</p><p>But as glad as he is for his brother’s freedom, it doesn’t mean his own lack of it weighs any less heavy on his soul.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Lan Huan’s heart sinks a little at the sadness in his own words. The happy, floating feeling he’d had only moments ago isn’t quite gone, but it’s certainly subdued. “But we have time, don’t we? To figure things out?”</p><p>Cultivators live long lives, and both of them haven’t yet seen their fourth decade. There’s no war either, to shorten every day and breed contingency plan after contingency plan, to feed desperation into every wild emotion.</p><p>“We do,” says the other man. His face is soft and open, but there’s no sadness there. “I’ve…done something.”</p><p>Lan Huan leans forward and listens as Wanyin describes – haltingly, because he’s no good at explanations outside of official briefings and mission reports – an arrangement he’s come to with his Council.</p><p>He won’t be taking a wife, he says. Nor will he be expected to have children. Lan Huan bites his tongue against the questions that immediately rise after that declaration, and waits for Wanyin to explain it to him.</p><p>It’s an old practice, from before the Wen clan first rose to power. Back when the sects weren’t clans but houses; when instead of being born into one, cultivators could choose the sect they would be apprenticed to. In those days, sect leadership wasn’t passed from father to son, the way it is now, but from a teacher to the most promising of his students.</p><p>“You mean to choose an heir,” Lan Huan says. It’s an elegant solution, if not a conventional one. “From among the disciples.”</p><p>“Not now, but yes.” Wanyin watches him closely, probably trying to detect any hint of disapproval. But Lan Huan doesn’t give it to him. He won’t. Perhaps everything would have been different if leadership had been granted based on ability rather than birthright. Perhaps they could have averted a war, and tens of underhanded political schemes. Perhaps neither of them would be sitting here now. “The Council has already approved. When I decide to… step down from my position, they will… assist me. In selecting my successor.”</p><p>“Why?”, Lan Huan asks. The question seems to catch the other man off guard. “The traditional way… would be smoother. Easier.” He doesn’t say <em>this might fail. We might fail.</em> He doesn’t need to. Both of them are aware of the possibility that the two of them might crash and burn. “You didn’t need to decide now.”</p><p>“I’m well aware of that.” The younger man’s fingers twitch towards his ring, as though he’s itching to touch Zidian, to twist it around his finger. But he doesn’t. Just clenches his hand into a fist and leaves it there on his thigh. “This decision – it’s not a recent development.”</p><p>“You mean it’s not about us.”</p><p>Wanyin nods. “I’ve been thinking about it for a while,” he admits. “I realised a long time ago that a normal marriage, children… Those things were never really in the cards for me.”</p><p>Lan Huan reaches out. Covers the other man’s fist with his own hand, brushing his wrist with his fingertips. He keeps his touch gentle, not trying to anchor Wanyin, but just to ground him.</p><p>“You’ve done well with your nephew,” he says lightly. “He’s a good kid. He loves you. And you love him.”</p><p>“I’m not cut out to be anyone’s father. I did my best for Jin Ling, but it wasn’t– it wasn’t good enough. Not like it should have been. Not like he deserved.”</p><p>The urge to correct him, to argue with him until he sees rises in Lan Huan, but Wanyin just shakes his head. “I’m not…good. At love. I’m not good at soft things, Lan Huan. Sooner or later, you’ll realise that.”</p><p>A smile touches the corners of Lan Huan’s mouth. “I know what I signed up for, you hard-headed idiot. I’m not going to leave you.”</p><p>“Yet.”</p><p>Ever the relentless optimist. Lan Huan sighs softly. <em>Slowly</em>, he reminds himself. <em>One step at a time.</em></p><p>“Yet,” he parrots back, but uses his fingers to pry open Wanyin’s fist. Splays his hand out flat across his leg so it can’t clench up again. “Now, let’s go outside. Knowing our brothers, they’re probably waiting for us.”</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Lan Huan is entirely unsurprised to see that they are, in fact, waiting. Along with Jin Ling and Sizhui too, who appear from behind a bush and nearly give Lan Huan a heart attack. Interestingly enough, Jingyi is nowhere in sight.</p><p>Wei Wuxian speaks first. Lan Huan’s brother is silent at his side, a shadow in white. Even now, their reunion a year in the past, Wangji still accompanies his husband everywhere they go, as though unwilling to let him out of his sight after thirteen years clinging to a memory. It makes Lan Huan’s heart ache a little, but Wangji looks content. Happy, even, as Lan Huan hasn’t seen him often, even when they were children. Perhaps especially when they were children.</p><p>Then, Wangji had followed Lan Huan everywhere, a fist tangled in the folds of Lan Huan’s robes like a security blanket. Now, he’s the one doing the protecting. Some of it, at least – Lan Huan hopes it isn’t all. His brother needs someone to look after him too, not just someone for him to look after.</p><p>“I take it everything went well, then.” The ex-Yiling Patriarch glances between the two sect leaders, nodding as though whatever invisible thing he’s seeing is somehow satisfactory. “You two worked things out?”</p><p>“Hard not to,” Wanyin retorts, but the vitriol the words should carry simply isn’t there. “You locked us in there. It’s not like we could leave and go our separate ways.”</p><p>“Well, it worked, didn’t it? Can’t argue with results.” Wei Wuxian shrugs, then waggles his eyebrows and gives a truly horrifying leer. “So, what did you two crazy kids get up to last night?”</p><p>The implications of that question smack Lan Huan in the face. He looks over at Wanyin, who’s already blushing desperately and scowling at his brother.</p><p>“Shut up, Wei Wuxian. We can’t all be as shameless as you.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian’s face breaks into a grin and he turns to the three teenagers, who look also resigned, as if they’re used to it.</p><p>“Jin Ling,” he says, looking over at his nephew, “did you know I once dared Jiang Cheng to walk the wall around Cloud Recesses in his underwear? And he actually did it?”</p><p>The young heir to the Jin sect makes an appropriately scandalised face, and Wanyin goes even redder.</p><p>“I had pants on, you sick fuck.” His cheeks are so flushed now that Lan Huan resists the urge to brush them with his hands to cool them down. The pink tint just makes his eyes look bluer.</p><p>From a few feet away, Wangji’s voice comes, steady and measured. “Didn’t need to know that.”</p><p>And all of a sudden, Lan Huan can’t help laughing, just for a moment. It doesn’t escape him that Jin Ling’s head turns towards him then, settles on the ribbon in his hair and the change in it. Lan Huan sees the spark of understanding flicker in the boy’s eyes. He opens his mouth, and everyone goes quiet.</p><p>“You’re together now?” It sounds small and soft, and younger than the young master’s going on seventeen years. But also a little bit pleased, behind the uncertainty and the vulnerability.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Jin Ling’s gaze flickers to his uncle. “And you’re happy with him?”</p><p>There’s a second of silence, and then Wanyin nods, his colour still not quite back to normal. His nephew makes a noise, sounding contemplative. He turns back to Lan Huan, staring at him, and suddenly, his self-possession seems to flow back into him. He looks…protective. Like an oversized guardian lion, the kind carved outside temples to protect the precious figures of the gods within.</p><p>Lan Huan can’t help but be reminded of Jiang Yanli, the eldest Jiang sibling, in the stubborn set of the child’s jaw. He’ll be a good student. A good cultivator, too.</p><p>“I’d give you the shovel talk,” Jin Ling says, his arms crossing over his chest in a pose that mirrors his uncle’s, “but honestly <em>Jiu-jiu</em>’s just lucky to find someone who will put up with him.”</p><p>Wanyin glowers but doesn’t say anything. Despite his words, there’s a spirit in the young master’s voice that suggests that he won’t hesitate to square off against a much stronger sect leader over twice his age for his uncle’s honor if Lan Huan messes up. It’s not quite a blessing, but near enough.</p><p>Lan Huan nods, giving his best placid smile, hoping to convey <em>I’ll take care of him</em> without words, to ease the boy’s familial worry without forcing Wanyin to lose face. He hopes he manages it, because Jin Ling steps back, seemingly satisfied.</p><p>“Any more stupid questions?” Wanyin’s scowl is back in full force, painted across all of his face. The furrow between his brows is as severe as ever. Lan Huan finds it ridiculously endearing. “Or will you let us go in peace?”</p><p>Wangji’s eyes narrow at him, and he holds up a hand in a gesture that clearly means <em>no</em>. “Wait.”</p><p>“What for?”, Lan Huan asks. “Is there something that’s supposed to happen?”</p><p>Just then, two figures emerge from the last bend in the corridor that leads back to the Cloud Recesses proper. They’re both dressed in white, one tall and one much shorter, looking up at the taller and chattering with childlike excitement. It’s Jingyi.</p><p>And the other is–</p><p>“Xichen.” The taller man’s voice is deep. Serious. “Sect Leader Jiang,” he says and bows. “Jingyi said you have something to tell me.”</p><p>It’s Shu-Fu.</p>

          <p>Hello and welcome back! Hope you all enjoyed this one. It was pretty tough to write, but next chapter is the fun part. Lan Qiren shows up!!!! I'm super excited to write that part, actually, and I hope you like it too.</p><p>On another note, recently, I've been consuming a lot of media. I watched all three seasons of 'Casa de Papel/Money Heist' in less than two weeks to prep for my Spanish finals, and fell in love with an amazing band called 'Vestuta Morla', which has beautiful lyricism and wonderful songs. Please check them out - my favourite songs are 'La Deriva', 'Cuarteles de Invierno' and 'Los Dias Raros' (the orchestral version is gorgeous).<br/>Also, I watched the movies 'Collateral' and 'Minority Report' within days of each other, and wow I love sci-fi thrillers. Maybe I'll write a fic like that someday.</p><p>Anyway, that's all for now. Hope you have a great day!!! :))))</p>

    <p>Lan Huan thinks he might be about to have a heart attack. All of a sudden, the garden goes completely still. The silence is so loud it echoes off the walls.</p><p>Shu-Fu is standing there, at the mouth of the corridor, arms at his sides and completely relaxed. The very picture of poise and control. But the muscles in his neck stand out with the effort of keeping his posture stiff. He’s tense; bracing for something.</p><p>Off to the side, Wei Wuxian looks – there’s no other word for it – <em>entertained</em>. Like the only thing that could make him more at ease with this whole disaster would be a couple sticks of <em>tanghulu</em> and some peanuts.</p><p>Lan Huan goes rigid. Darts an accusatory glance at Wangji, who stares right back at him.</p><p><em>You told him?</em> Lan Huan’s mouth doesn’t move, though he knows Wangji can understand him just fine.</p><p>Wangji remains expressionless, but there’s a flash of emotion in his eyes that Lan Huan interprets as <em>this is an intervention, Dage</em>. <em>It had to happen sometime</em>.</p><p>Panic rises in Lan Huan’s chest, filling his lungs. He turns back to his uncle, to see him watching expectantly as both he and Wanyin stand motionless in some sort of silent staredown.</p><p>“Master Lan,” Wanyin says. His voice is cool, polite, and Lan Huan marvels at the calmness of it. How far the younger man has come since a little over a year ago. Wanyin lowers himself into a bow – a shallow one, befitting his status as the Jiang Sect Leader and a visiting dignitary. But it’s also deeper than common respect for superior age and experience can explain, and as Wanyin straightens back up, the shock is clearly written across Shu-Fu’s face.</p><p>It’s a bow more suited to a young man addressing a family elder, or a parent-in-law. A cold feeling manifests in Lan Huan’s stomach, crystallising into ice.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this?”, Shu-Fu asks. His voice is as even as ever, but when he finishes speaking, his lips press together so hard they go white. “Xichen?”</p><p>“Shu-Fu.” Lan Huan’s reply is hoarse, and Wanyin snaps his head back to look at him, taking a small step closer as if to offer comfort by physical proximity. The movement doesn’t go unnoticed by Shu-Fu, whose eyes narrow. “I’ve– I’ve decided. I’m coming out of seclusion.”</p><p>Lan Huan tenses his shoulders, steels himself for the inevitable explosion. The disapproving tone, the disappointed look, the <em>this isn’t how a sect leader should make decisions </em>that Lan Huan’s been hearing in his head for the entirety of the last few weeks, as he locked himself in the cottage and refused nearly all visitors.</p><p><em>Look at you</em>, his mind had whispered in Shu-Fu’s voice. <em>Irresponsible. Coming and going from society as you please. Retreating when you can no longer handle the pressure and returning when you feel like it.</em></p><p><em>Weak</em>, it had said.</p><p><em>Like your father</em>, it had said.</p><p>Lan Huan had known it wasn’t real. Die had been Shu-Fu’s older brother for longer than he’s been Lan Huan’s uncle, and Lan Huan has never heard a single word against him his whole life. Not from Shu-Fu, who had brought Die his meals every day for the years after Niang passed because the way Die never talked, never acknowledged any change in his surroundings, disturbed the servants. Scared them. It scared Lan Huan too, truth be told, and it terrified Wangji even more.</p><p>But Shu-Fu never complained. He visited Die every single day, even when the sect leader duties he’d taken on in his brother’s place weighed heavy on him and the circles around his eyes became so dark that Lan Huan could just <em>tell</em> he wasn’t sleeping through the nights.</p><p>Shu-Fu would never say those things. But perhaps he’s thought them. Maybe every day, maybe on the way to every conference he had to attend because they couldn’t send a sect leader who never opened his mouth.</p><p><em>I raised you better than this</em>, Lan Huan hears now. The words ring in Shu-Fu’s voice, and Lan Huan’s throat dries up. <em>I raised you to be strong.</em></p><p>Shu-Fu hadn’t visited him every single day. He hadn’t come at all for the first month Lan Huan retreated into seclusion, and even after that, Lan Huan only saw his face twice a week.</p><p>But here, now, Shu-Fu doesn’t scoff at him. Doesn’t give him that cold, dispassionate look that Lan Huan’s been afraid of ever since he was a child. Instead, his expression cracks open, right down the middle. Inside it, there’s something raw and soft – soft not like the velvety fur of a rabbit’s ear but the soft that comes when a sword shears right through your belly and for a moment, as you hold your insides where they’re supposed to be inside of you, you think you can feel your stomach against your palm.</p><p>But it’s just for a second. Lan Huan nearly glances away. And then the second is over, and the crack seals itself back up. The soft thing is gone, and Lan Huan is almost glad.</p><p>“And the letter from the matchmakers…is it true?”</p><p>Lan Huan nods.</p><p>Then, slowly, Shu-Fu turns away from his nephew, towards Wanyin, who hasn’t made a sound all this time. Their eyes meet and something passes between them – something Lan Huan can’t read. When it’s over, Shu-Fu faces Lan Huan again.</p><p>“It was him, wasn’t it.” Despite the phrasing, it’s not a question. Lan Huan nods again anyway, suddenly feeling very small under his uncle’s stare. Like he’s nine years old again and he’s done something wrong, back before Lan Huan first learned how to smile like nothing was wrong and promised himself he’d be perfect. “Jingyi told me you’ve been meeting.”</p><p>“For the sect conference, Shu-Fu. He was giving me reports so that I might be kept up-to-date.”</p><p>“The conference has been over for nearly a month.”</p><p>Lan Huan opens his mouth to say something, anything. Perhaps <em>I can explain</em> or <em>it’s not like that</em> or simply, pathetically, just <em>please</em>. But it is like that, and from the way Shu-Fu is looking between the two of them, he knows it too.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he says instead. Beside him, Wanyin tenses up, and Lan Huan instantly regrets the words. He’s not ashamed of him. He’s not. He knows that’s how the younger man will take it, but he’s wrong. Because the truth is that the person Lan Huan is ashamed of here is himself.</p><p>
  <em>I’m sorry I’m weak, Uncle. I promised that I’d never fall in love. I promised that I wouldn’t be like Die or Wangji. That I’d never give my heart to anyone. That I’d be like you instead.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>But I couldn’t keep that promise.</em>
</p><p>“What for?”, Shu-Fu asks. His voice is devoid of emotion once again, and it makes a little part of Lan Huan’s chest ache, somewhere behind his lungs. “What is it that you are apologising for?”</p><p>“Shu-Fu, I–”</p><p>“You said nothing, Ah-Huan.” Lan Huan freezes at the sound of his childhood nickname, and the words he hadn’t, in a thousand years, been expecting. <em>What?</em> “You and your brother both. Neither of you said anything.”</p><p>The older man’s face is beginning to grow a little pale, but it isn’t from anger. It’s from something else. Something Lan Huan hadn’t anticipated.</p><p>Only a short distance away, Wangji looks distinctly uncomfortable, like he’d like nothing better than to shuffle his feet. It’s apparent that he hadn’t expected to be dragged into this.</p><p>“If there is one thing that is not prohibited in Cloud Recesses,” says Shu-Fu – and it’s a mark of how far out-of-character all of this is for him that no one remarks on the indirect jibe at their clan rules – “it is the truth. Is that what you thought, both of you? That you would be…punished…for telling the truth?”</p><p><em>For telling me</em>, he doesn’t say. Lan Huan’s throat begins to ache.</p><p>“First your brother, Ah-Huan. And now you.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian interrupts. “With all due respect, Master Lan, Wangji and I are married. We did tell you–”</p><p>“Shut up.” The jaws of everyone present fall to the floor, and no one makes so much as a move to pick them back up. Shu-Fu is being rude. No, more than that, he’s being <em>improper</em>.</p><p>“With all due <em>respect</em>, Wei Wuxian,” says Shu-Fu, face now all the way white, “shut up.”</p><p>“Thirteen years,” he continues. “Thirteen years that Wangji said nothing. I thought he had lost his mind.”</p><p>“I did not.” Wangji speaks for the first time, and his voice is soft. There’s little of the steel in it that Lan Huan has come to expect from his little brother.</p><p>“I know that now. But I did not then, and you allowed me to go on not knowing until the time came that it mattered little.” Shu-Fu takes a breath. “Did you think you would be cast out? Were you afraid of what would be done to you?”</p><p>
  <em>Were you afraid of me?</em>
</p><p>Wangji says nothing. Lan Huan doesn’t speak either. All of a sudden, Lan Huan notices that Shu-Fu is trembling. His hands are not steady. They are always steady.</p><p>Everyone else is watching. Saying nothing as well, only waiting for this to unfold. Young Master Jin is biting his lip, a hand on Sizhui’s arm as if to provide comfort. From what, Lan Huan is not certain. Jingyi’s fingers are knotted in his robes. They will crease later.</p><p>Shu-Fu looks down at his hands. At his fingers, shaking with the smallest of tremors. His expression doesn’t change. “Perhaps I have failed,” he says with the air of the idle, though Lan Huan knows he is nothing but. “I did my best to keep the two of you from repeating my brother’s mistakes by shielding you from the path he took to make them. I thought I could steer you away from them entirely.”</p><p>The lump in Lan Huan’s throat grows as Shu-Fu talks. Tears sting the corners of his eyes. From the looks of it, Wangji too is having difficulty swallowing.</p><p>Wanyin seems to sense his discomfort. He turns to glance at Lan Huan, hesitating for a second at what he finds there. Then he appears to come to a decision, and reaches out discreetly to touch his hand to Lan Huan’s arm. The warmth is grounding. Lan Huan shouldn’t need it as much as he does.</p><p>“But I should have known that the young will always find a way.” Here, Shu-Fu goes quiet, seemingly struggling with what to say next. When he begins again, it is with something in his voice that doesn’t sound quite right. It sounds like desperation. “I should have known you were not your father. Neither of you.”</p><p>Throughout this conversation, Lan Huan has been trying to rein in his emotions, to overcome the rising knot of <em>feeling</em> that’s working its way up his throat, threatening to crawl into his mouth and then out into the open air. With Shu-Fu’s words, he can’t fight it anymore. Wetness spills out of his eyes and down his cheeks. Lan Huan tastes salt in the corners of his mouth.</p><p>And suddenly, he’s crying. Face damp and shoulders shaking soundlessly, and everyone in his family is here and they’re <em>watching</em> and he’s been trying to avoid just this but for now Lan Huan can’t give a damn. He doesn’t do this. He doesn’t break down in front of other people, but beside him, Wangji is crying too and that makes this okay. His brother shouldn’t have to be the only one.</p><p>Eventually, Lan Huan chokes out in a shaky voice, “I wanted to be like you.”</p><p>“I never wanted you to be like me.”</p><p>It’s then that Lan Huan realises that Shu-Fu is crying with them. Just as soundless, his posture still as perfect as ever, so that the effect is like if a rock were to weep. His eyes are red against the paleness of the rest of his face, against the pure snowy whiteness of his robes. Lan Huan has never seen him cry before.</p><p><em>You said nothing</em>. His uncle’s words ring in his head, over and over, growing louder each time. <em>You said nothing</em>.</p><p>They’ve left him behind, Lan Huan realises. All of them. Die, who dropped all his duties to marry Niang without a word to his brother before Shu-Fu found himself saddled with all the responsibilities he never thought he’d have to bear. Wangji, who hid his love – hid <em>himself</em> – for thirteen years before up and eloping with someone the rest of them barely knew. None of them had even been invited to the wedding.</p><p>And now Lan Huan, on the edge of doing the same. Secluding himself, just like Die. Falling in love and hiding it, just like Wangji.</p><p><em>You said nothing</em>.</p><p>But he doesn’t voice that. Because Lan Huan knows his uncle, knows how proud he is, as everyone in their family is. Saying that will strip away all the face he has left, and the last thing Lan Huan wants is to hurt his family more than he already has.</p><p>One day, he’ll tell his uncle that he loves him. That he trusts him. That he’s thankful for all the years Shu-Fu put into raising them, taking care of them when their own parents couldn’t. But he won’t say that now. Not here, with everyone watching and all their nerves peeled raw.</p><p>Instead, he wipes at his face. Gets himself under control and asks, “aren’t you angry? Or disappointed? Or something, at least?”</p><p>It’s what he’d expected from his uncle. Outrage, at getting himself into a relationship with another sect leader. Shock, that Lan Huan, who has always tried to do the good thing, the correct thing, has strayed so far from the path laid out for him. In the place of that, though, he’s received only a strange sort of resignation, as though Shu-Fu saw this coming. As though he’s known for a while now that Lan Huan isn’t the sort of person he’s always thought he was.</p><p>“I’m an old man,” Shu-Fu says heavily. His eyes are still red-rimmed, but they’re no longer damp and shining. “I left such things as standards behind me long ago. My standards are low: your Sect Leader Jiang has not murdered anyone in my family, and he is not a necromancer, not to mention he is one of our oldest allies.”</p><p>Wei Wuxian shifts guiltily in his position beside Wangji, whose expression has gone blank again, though Lan Huan can still see traces of the rawness from moments ago.</p><p>“I am far from happy with this,” Shu-Fu continues, “but I will, as they say… deal with it.”</p><p>He takes a step towards them. All of them, until he’s no longer standing apart like the intruder he is not, but is somewhere in the little bubble of their family. He lays a hand on Lan Huan’s shoulder, and looks him in the eyes. There are little wrinkles in the corners of them, crows’ feet that aren’t there normally.</p><p>“You have done well for yourselves,” he says to Lan Huan, and to Wangji, and then turns to face the others. Looks at Wanyin and Jin Ling, who have little family of their own, and Sizhui, who perhaps was always meant to be one of them. Wei Wuxian, their most reluctant (on both sides) acquisition, and Jingyi, who’s truthfully only distantly related to the Lan brothers on their mother’s side.</p><p>They are all broken somehow, in their own ways. All a little messed-up and imperfect, struggling to move on. But even though they’re not there yet, they’ll get there someday, and Lan Huan thinks to himself that now is as good a time as any to start.</p><p>Wanyin’s hand slides down Lan Huan’s arm, into his palm. Their fingers lace together.</p><p>It feels like coming home.</p>

          <p>That's it folks. We've come to the end of this monster fanfic, and whew am I relieved. That was a wild ride, and the longest thing I've ever written, and I'm so happy to have written it, because it felt incredibly cathartic and also rewarding. Thank you to everyone who has ever read, kudos-ed, and/or commented here. I'm very grateful to all of you. Thank you especially to everyone on Discord and Tumblr, who has fed my MDZS obsession (and also my ego), and to my friend from class who fangirls with me about MDZS (I know she's not on here, but I gotta thank her anyway because she's amazing). I love you all. &lt;3333</p><p>A side note - about this last chapter, I've chosen to end it here because it's kind of the end of the line for our heroes. They've come clean with their whole family, are on pretty decent terms with all living relatives and friends, and are ready to move on and begin healing properly with support from their friends, family and each other. They're not "fixed" yet, as is the nature of trauma, and they may never be, but I hope that I've managed to get them to a place where they can work things out on their own and keep getting better.</p><p>Also, if you've read the chapter summary, I have a video that I made based on the song I titled this chapter after. The link is right here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12YBORt_gOo5-UVTskZTypohoq-vsgMnY/view?usp=sharing</p><p>Again, thank you guys for everything, and as always, I hope you have a great day!</p>
